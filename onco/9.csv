Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919709@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@RATIOPHARM@@@@@RATIOPHARM||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@51.64@76.28@53.97@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@2.58@2.58@2512307@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@12@MCG@12 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer. Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs (PDGFR, RET, or KIT) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRß- and VEGFR2-dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo.@@15299378@Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor GIST: indicated for the treatment of GIST after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate.

NEUPOGEN containing rmetHuGCSF (filgrastim) causes marked increases in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within twenty-four hours, with minor increases in monocytes. In some severe chronic neutropenia patients filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and basophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia already prior to treatment. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dosedependent at recommended doses. Neutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@51.64@76.28@53.97@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@2.58@2.58@6326180@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@12@MCG@12 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918442@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@RATIOPHARM@@@@@RATIOPHARM||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@96.58@133.09@100.32@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@4.83@4.83@1039398@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MCG@25 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

[Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1.1511@4.26@16.37@5.09@@@@@@@@@@0.57@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@4.26@4.26@4767715@SOLUTION FOR INJECTION (1 ML)@EURO@@@@@@@@7.5@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma.

Dosage recommendations may be converted from those in terms of bodyweight to those related to surface area by means of nomograms, as presented in Documenta Geigy. 1) Remission induction: a) Continuous treatment: i) Rapid injection  2 mg/kg/day is a judicious starting dose. Administer for 10 days. Obtain daily blood counts. If no antileukaemic effect is noted and there is no apparent toxicity, increase to 4 mg/kg/day and maintain until therapeutic response or toxicity is evident. Almost all patients can be carried to toxicity with these doses. ii) 0.5  1.0 mg/kg/day may be given in an infusion of up to 24 hours duration. Results from onehour infusions have been satisfactory in the majority of patients. After 10 days this initial daily dose may be increased to 2 mg/kg/day subject to toxicity. Continue to toxicity or until remission occurs. b) Intermittent treatment: 3-5 mg/kg/day are administered intravenously on each of five consecutive days. After a two to nineday rest period, a further course is given. Continue until response or toxicity occurs. The first evidence of marrow improvement has been reported to occur 7  64 days (mean 28 days) after the beginning of therapy. In general, if a patient shows neither toxicity nor remission after a fair trial, the cautious administration of higher doses is warranted. As a rule, patients have been seen to tolerate higher doses when given by rapid intravenous injection as compared with slow infusion. This difference is due to the rapid metabolism of Cytarabine and the consequent short duration of action of the high dose. 2) Maintenance therapy: Remissions which have been induced by Cytarabine, or by other drugs, may be maintained by intravenous or subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg once or twice weekly.@@@@@@@Only physicians experienced in cancer chemotherapy should use Cytarabine for Injection USP.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917820@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

When bound to the polymer, paclitaxel is rendered inactive, potentially sparing normal tissue's exposure to high levels of the active drug and its associated toxicities. Blood vessels in tumor tissue, unlike blood vessels in normal tissue, are porous to molecules like polyglutamate. Based on preclinical studies, it appears that Opaxio is preferentially distributed to tumors due to their leaky blood vessels and trapped in the tumor bed allowing significantly more of the dose of chemotherapy to localize in the tumor than with standard paclitaxel. Once inside the tumor cell, enzymes metabolize the protein polymer, releasing the paclitaxel chemotherapy. Preclinical and clinical studies support that Opaxio metabolism by lung cancer cells may be influenced by estrogen, which could lead to enhanced release of paclitaxel and efficacy in women with lung cancer compared to standard therapies.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917819@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922940@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922525@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration.

This effect is reversible on discontinuation of therapy. Administration of leuprorelin acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of gonadotrophins which leads to a transient increase in gonadal steroid levels in both men and women. Continued administration of leuprorelin acetate results in a decrease of gonadotrophin and sex steroid levels.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@NOVARTIS@SANDOZ@@@@NOVARTIS|SANDOZ|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@167.91@223.28@173.9@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@16.79@16.79@2231258@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT.

VEGF and PDGF are growth factors critical to the development and growth of blood vessels - a process known as angiogenesis. Angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in the growth and spread of several tumour types, with VEGF and PDGF overexpression linked to multiple cancers including cancers of the liver, lung, breast, kidney, bladder, ovaries, and colon. By inhibiting VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-kit pazopanib may stop or slow the rate of tumour growth and development. Pazopanib is currently being studied in a number of different tumour types; clinical trials are currently underway in renal cell carcinoma (Phase III), breast cancer (Phase III in inflammatory breast cancer), ovarian cancer, STS, NSCLC, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.

The effects of perifosine on Akt are of particular interest because of the importance of this pathway in the development of most cancers, the evidence that it is often activated in tumors that are resistant to other forms of anticancer therapy, and the difficulty encountered thus far in the discovery of drugs that will inhibit this pathway without causing excessive toxicity. High levels of activated Akt (pAkt) are seen frequently in many types of cancer and have been correlated with poor prognosis in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma, gastric, hepatocellular, endometrial, prostate, renal cell, head and neck cancers and hematological malignancies, as well as glioblastoma. The majority of tumors expressing high levels of pAkt were high-grade, advanced stage or had other features associated with poor prognosis. High pAkt is often seen in tumors that are resistant to conventional cancer treatments, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and especially therapy with some of the newer biologicals. Published data suggest that the Akt pathway is frequently activated in renal cell cancer and that this tumor type may be particularly responsive to Akt inhibition.@@14916691@-@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Keryx receives notice from Nasdaq that the company is not in compliance with the US$1 minimum bid price for continued listing and most reach this within 180 days.

The inhibition profile of ABT-869 is evident in cellular assays of RTK phosphorylation (IC50 = 2, 4, and 7 nmol/L for PDGFR-ß, KDR, and CSF-1R, respectively) and VEGF-stimulated proliferation (IC50 = 0.2 nmol/L for human endothelial cells). ABT-869 is not a general antiproliferative agent because, in most cancer cells, >1,000-fold higher concentrations of ABT-869 are required for inhibition of proliferation. However, ABT-869 exhibits potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on cancer cells whose proliferation is dependent on mutant kinases, such as FLT3. In vivo ABT-869 is effective orally in the mechanism-based murine models of VEGF-induced uterine edema (ED50 = 0.5 mg/kg) and corneal angiogenesis (>50% inhibition, 15 mg/kg). In tumor growth studies, ABT-869 exhibits efficacy in human fibrosarcoma and breast, colon, and small cell lung carcinoma xenograft models (ED50 = 1.5–5 mg/kg, twice daily) and is also effective (>50% inhibition) in orthotopic breast and glioma models.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922938@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14920100@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal. Pamidronate disodium therapy in patients with Paget's disease has been effective in reducing serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels by = 50% in at least 50% of patients, and by = 30% in at least 80% of patients. Pamidronate disodium therapy has also been effective in reducing these biochemical markers in patients with Paget's disease who failed to respond, or no longer responded to other treatments.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918425@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@KREWEL MEUSELBACH@@@@@KREWEL MEUSELBACH||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@91.03@126.07@94.59@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@4.55@4.55@3836621@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MCG@25 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919478@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

The effects of perifosine on Akt are of particular interest because of the importance of this pathway in the development of most cancers, the evidence that it is often activated in tumors that are resistant to other forms of anticancer therapy, and the difficulty encountered thus far in the discovery of drugs that will inhibit this pathway without causing excessive toxicity. High levels of activated Akt (pAkt) are seen frequently in many types of cancer and have been correlated with poor prognosis in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma, gastric, hepatocellular, endometrial, prostate, renal cell, head and neck cancers and hematological malignancies, as well as glioblastoma. The majority of tumors expressing high levels of pAkt were high-grade, advanced stage or had other features associated with poor prognosis. High pAkt is often seen in tumors that are resistant to conventional cancer treatments, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and especially therapy with some of the newer biologicals.

A lower initial dosage (12 mg/m2 or less) is recommended for patients with inadequate bone marrow reserves e.g. due to prior chemotherapy or poor general condition. Combination Therapy: Mitoxantrone has been given as part of combination therapy. In metastatic breast cancer, combinations of mitoxantrone with other cytotoxic agents including cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil, or methotrexate and mitomycin C, have been shown to be effective. Reference should be made to the published literature for information on dosage modifications and administration. Mitoxantrone has also been used in various combinations for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, however data are presently limited and specific regimens cannot be recommended. As a guide, when mitoxantrone is used in combination chemotherapy with another myelosuppressive agent, the initial dose of mitoxantrone should be reduced by 2-4 mg/m2 below the doses recommended for single agent use. Subsequent doses, as outlined in the table above, depend on the degree and duration of myelosuppression.@@@@@@@There may be an increased risk of leukaemia when mitoxantrone is used as adjuvant treatment of non-metastatic breast cancer. In the absence of sufficient efficacy data, mitoxantrone must not be used as adjuvant treatment of non-metastatic breast cancer. Mitoxantrone should be used with caution in patients with myelosuppression or poor general condition. Cases of functional cardiac changes, including congestive heart failure and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction have been reported during mitoxantrone therapy. These cardiac events have occurred most commonly in patients who have had prior treatment with anthracyclines, prior mediastinal/thoracic radiotherapy, or in patients with pre-existing heart disease. The concomitant administration of other cardiotoxic drugs may also increase the risk of cardiac toxicity. It is recommended that patients in these categories are treated with mitoxantrone at full cytotoxic dosage and schedule.

Activating mutations of Ras and upstream elements of Ras may play a role in greater than two thirds of all human cancers. Reolysin may represent a novel treatment for Ras activated tumour cells and some cellular proliferative disorders. Reovirus, an acronym for Respiratory Enteric Orphan virus, is generally believed to inhabit the respiratory and bowel systems in humans. Reovirus is found naturally in sewage and water supplies. By age 12, half of all children show evidence of reovirus exposure and by adulthood, most people have been exposed. However, the disease is non-pathogenic, meaning there are typically no symptoms from infections. The link to its cancer-killing ability was established after the reovirus was discovered to reproduce well in various cancer cell lines. Tumours bearing an activated Ras pathway are deficient in their ability to activate the anti-viral response mediated by the host cellular protein, PKR. Since PKR is responsible for preventing reovirus replication, tumour cells lacking the activity of PKR are susceptible to reovirus replication. As normal cells do not possess Ras activations, these cells are able to stop reovirus infection through normal PKR activity. In tumour cells with an activated Ras pathway, reovirus is able to freely replicate and eventually kill the host tumour cells. As cell death occurs, progeny virus particles are then free to infect surrounding cancer cells. This cycle of infection, replication and cell death is believed to be repeated until there are no longer any tumour cells carrying an activated Ras pathway available.@@14922089@Ovarian epithelial cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer that did not respond to platinum chemotherapy@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@SECOND-LINE@NCT00602277@70@-@-@@@-@@10/1/2008@-@C0028@@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@Trial started.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma.

In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT.

The acute increase in plasma levels of uric acid subsequent to the lysis of large numbers of malignant cells and during cytoreductive chemotherapy may lead to impairment of renal function and renal failure resulting from the precipitation of crystals of uric acid in renal tubules. Rasburicase is a highly potent uricolytic agent that catalyses enzymatic oxidation of uric acid into allantoin, a water soluble product, easily excreted by the kidneys in the urine. The enzymatic oxidation of uric acid leads to stoichiometric formation of hydrogen peroxide.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14920108@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal. Pamidronate disodium therapy in patients with Paget's disease has been effective in reducing serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels by = 50% in at least 50% of patients, and by = 30% in at least 80% of patients. Pamidronate disodium therapy has also been effective in reducing these biochemical markers in patients with Paget's disease who failed to respond, or no longer responded to other treatments. Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer and Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma: Pamidronate disodium is indicated, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy, for the treatment of osteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer and osteolytic lesions of multiple myeloma. The pamidronate disodium treatment effect appeared to be smaller in the study of breast cancer patients receiving hormonal therapy than in the study of those receiving chemotherapy, however, overall evidence of clinical benefit has been demonstrated.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Acquired through takeover of Mayne Pharma, which acquired it from Faulding@@@392@The recommended dose of pamidronate disodium in patients with osteolytic bone lesions of multiple myeloma is 90 mg administered as a 4-hour infusion given on a monthly basis.

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14922919@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses. Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: indicated in the management of selected adults with severe, active, rheumatoid arthritis (ARC criteria), or children with active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate. Combined use of methotrexate with gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or cytotoxic agents, has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects. Rest and physiotherapy as indicated should be continued.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@N/A@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@DAVA PHARMACEUTICALS@@@@@DAVA PHARMACEUTICALS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@RHEUMATREX@@@@@RHEUMATREX||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@16@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@67253-0580-44@TABLET@US$@@@@@@@@2.5@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919568@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Dosage recommendations may be converted from those in terms of bodyweight to those related to surface area by means of nomograms, as presented in Documenta Geigy. 1) Remission induction: a) Continuous treatment: i) Rapid injection  2 mg/kg/day is a judicious starting dose. Administer for 10 days. Obtain daily blood counts. If no antileukaemic effect is noted and there is no apparent toxicity, increase to 4 mg/kg/day and maintain until therapeutic response or toxicity is evident. Almost all patients can be carried to toxicity with these doses. ii) 0.5  1.0 mg/kg/day may be given in an infusion of up to 24 hours duration. Results from onehour infusions have been satisfactory in the majority of patients. After 10 days this initial daily dose may be increased to 2 mg/kg/day subject to toxicity. Continue to toxicity or until remission occurs. b) Intermittent treatment: 3-5 mg/kg/day are administered intravenously on each of five consecutive days. After a two to nineday rest period, a further course is given. Continue until response or toxicity occurs. The first evidence of marrow improvement has been reported to occur 7  64 days (mean 28 days) after the beginning of therapy. In general, if a patient shows neither toxicity nor remission after a fair trial, the cautious administration of higher doses is warranted. As a rule, patients have been seen to tolerate higher doses when given by rapid intravenous injection as compared with slow infusion. This difference is due to the rapid metabolism of Cytarabine and the consequent short duration of action of the high dose. 2) Maintenance therapy: Remissions which have been induced by Cytarabine, or by other drugs, may be maintained by intravenous or subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg once or twice weekly.@1-Dec-97@12/1/1997@3/19/1972@@@@Only physicians experienced in cancer chemotherapy should use Cytarabine for Injection USP.

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14919872@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses.

Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate.

Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@N/A@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@BEDFORD LABORATORIES@@@@@BEDFORD LABORATORIES||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Endometrial Cancer@Breast Cancer@NSCLC@Head & Neck Cancer@@Endometrial Cancer|Breast Cancer|NSCLC|Head & Neck Cancer||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@10@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@55390-0032-10@INJECTION@US$@@@@@@@@100@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@RATIOPHARM@@@@@RATIOPHARM||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@23.86@41.15@25.31@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@4.77@4.77@1039375@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MCG@25 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

In vitro, zoledronic acid inhibits osteoclastic activity and induces osteoclast apoptosis. Zoledronic acid also blocks the osteoclastic resorption of mineralized bone and cartilage through its binding to bone. Zoledronic acid inhibits the increased osteoclastic activity and skeletal calcium release induced by various stimulatory factors released by tumors.@@14922337@Tamoxifen Versus Anastrozole, Alone or in Combination With Zoledronic Acid, in Premenopausal, Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer Patients (Stage I, II) @@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00295646@1803@-@-@@@-@@6/1/1999@-@ABCSG-12@@-@>> Premenopausal, hormone receptor-positive patient     >>Histologically verified (minimally) invasive breast cancer, local radical treatment     >> 0-9 involved axillary lymph nodes (= 10 histologically examined nodes)      >> Tumor stage: pT1b-3, yT0 or yT1a@@@III@III@@-@-@After a median follow-up of 60 months (March 31, 2008), disease-free and overall survival rates were at 94.0% and 98.2%, respectively. A total of 137 first DFS events were reported. Of these, 72 occurred in patients treated with anastrozole, and the remaining 65 occurred in those treated with tamoxifen. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in the primary endpoint of DFS according to the endocrine treatment used, but there was a significant difference according to whether or not patients had been given the bisphosphonate. Of the 137 DFS events, 54 occurred in women who had received zoledronic acid, with the remaining 83 in those who had not received the drug. This gave a hazard ratio of 0.643 (95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.91), with a p value of 0.011, in favor of bisphosphonate use over no bisphosphonate use. There was no significant difference in DFS, relapse-free survival or overall survival when comparing anastrozole with tamoxifen, possibly because of the dominant effect of ovarian suppression with goserelin in premenopausal patients. However,  The results of ongoing studies are needed before any definite guidance can be given on the use of endocrine therapy in premenopausal women undergoing ovarian suppression, he suggested. The effects of zoledronic acid appeared to occur in and outside the bone, with a decreased risk of contralateral breast cancer, locoregional, and distant recurrence. The authors concluded that although the optimal regimen of adjuvant zoledronic acid is to be determined, adjuvant treatment with zoledronic acid should be considered in order to improve the standard of care in premenopausal women with breast cancer.

Peak plasma concentrations of about 30ng/ml are attained approximately 1.5 hours after an 8mg dose. For doses above 8mg the increase in ondansetron systemic exposure with dose is greater than proportional; this may reflect some reduction in first pass metabolism at higher oral doses. Bioavailability, following oral administration, is slightly enhanced by the presence of food but unaffected by antacids. Studies in healthy elderly volunteers have shown slight, but clinically insignificant, age-related increases in both oral bioavailability (65%) and half-life (5 hours) of ondansetron. Gender differences were shown in the disposition of ondansetron, with females having a greater rate and extent of absorption following an oral dose and reduced systemic clearance and volume of distribution (adjusted for weight).  The disposition of ondansetron following oral, intramuscular(IM) and intravenous(IV) dosing is similar with a terminal half life of about 3 hours and steady state volume of distribution of about 140L.

The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@1 A PHARMA@@@@@1 A PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@260.52@340.36@269.42@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@13.03@13.03@683513@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@75@MCG@75 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

14917597@Onco@@@@@300f1018ntsdm@@@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@L01AA01@L01A@NO@NEW YORK, NEW YORK@@@Cyclophosphamide is an antineoplastic agent which is converted in the body to an active alkylating metabolite. It also possesses marked immunosuppressant properties. The principal site of cyclophosphamide activation is the liver. The chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant activity of cyclophosphamide is thought to be mediated by the cytotoxic intermediates produced by activation by mixed function oxidases in hepatic microsomes. Non-enzymatic cleavage, possibly taking place in the tumour cells, results in the formulation of highly cytotoxic forms of the drug.@@14917597@Although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to Cytoxan treatment: 1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma. 2. Multiple myeloma. 3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (Cytoxan given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration). 4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). 5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). 6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 7. Retinoblastoma. 8. Carcinoma of the breast. Cytoxan is also used in non-malignant disease: it is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid therapy or in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, Cytoxan may induce a remission. Cytoxan is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.@@NO@-@@-@@@-@-@-@-@-@-@When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of Cytoxan for patients with no hematologic deficiency usually consists of 40 to 50 mg/kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens include 10 to 15 mg/kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 to 5 mg/kg twice weekly. Many other regimens of intravenous and oral Cytoxan have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia. When Cytoxan is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose as well as that of the other drugs. Cytoxan and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of Cytoxan metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.@Nov-59@@@-@@@Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoproliferative malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically. Urinary System: Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal. Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Cardiac Toxicity: Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium. No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Infections: Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@-@-@@@-@DISCONTINUED@@-@PBS@NO LABELLED TRIAL@-@@@@-@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE||||@BMS@@@@@BMS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@Breast Cancer@Ovarian Cancer@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia|Breast Cancer|Ovarian Cancer||||||@ENDOXAN@@@@@ENDOXAN||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@-@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@-@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@12.5MG/KGx42.941@@@@1@0.8893@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@L01AA011080WBX@POWDER FOR INJECTION (SOLVENT REQUIRED)@A$@@@@@@@@1@G@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@23@Australia@@@@@@@@

SOURCE: Cell Therapeutics@@-@-@-@SEATTLE, WASHINGTON@4/1/2007@@Opaxio (paclitaxel poliglumex, CT-2103), which was previously branded as Xyotax, is an investigational, biologically enhanced, chemotherapeutic that links paclitaxel, the active ingredient in Taxol(R), to a biodegradable polyglutamate polymer, which results in a new chemical entity. When bound to the polymer, paclitaxel is rendered inactive, potentially sparing normal tissue's exposure to high levels of the active drug and its associated toxicities. Blood vessels in tumor tissue, unlike blood vessels in normal tissue, are porous to molecules like polyglutamate. Based on preclinical studies, it appears that Opaxio is preferentially distributed to tumors due to their leaky blood vessels and trapped in the tumor bed allowing significantly more of the dose of chemotherapy to localize in the tumor than with standard paclitaxel. Once inside the tumor cell, enzymes metabolize the protein polymer, releasing the paclitaxel chemotherapy. Preclinical and clinical studies support that Opaxio metabolism by lung cancer cells may be influenced by estrogen, which could lead to enhanced release of paclitaxel and efficacy in women with lung cancer compared to standard therapies.

Like other glucocorticoids, dexamethasone also has anti-allergic, antipyretic and immunosuppressive properties. Dexamethasone has practically no water and salt-retaining properties and is, therefore, particularly suitable for the use in patients with cardiac failure or hypertension. Because of its long biological half-life (36-54 hours), dexamethasone is especially suitable in conditions where continuous glucocorticoid action is desired.@@14918307@Allergic states: Control of severe or incapacitating allergic conditions intractable to adequate trials of conventional treatment in asthma, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, drug hypersensitivity reactions, perennial or seasonal allergic rhinitis, and serum sickness. Dermatologic diseases: Bullous dermatitis herpetiformis, exfoliative erythroderma, mycosis fungoides, pemphigus, and severe erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome). Endocrine disorders: Primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency (hydrocortisone or cortisone is the drug of choice; may be used in conjunction with synthetic mineralocorticoid analogs where applicable; in infancy mineralocorticoid supplementation is of particular importance), congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hypercalcemia associated with cancer, and nonsuppurative thyroiditis. Gastrointestinal diseases: To tide the patient over a critical period of the disease in regional enteritis and ulcerative colitis. Haematologic disorders: Acquired (autoimmune) hemolytic anemia, congenital (erythroid) hypoplastic anemia (Diamond-Blackfan anaemia), idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura in adults, pure red cell aplasia, and selected cases of secondary thrombocytopaenia. Miscellaneous: Diagnostic testing of adrenocortical hyperfunction, trichinosis with neurologic or myocardial involvement, tuberculous meningitis with subarachnoid block or impending block when used with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy. Neoplastic diseases: For the palliative management of leukemias and lymphomas. Nervous system: Acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, cerebral edema associated with primary or metastatic brain tumour, craniotomy, or head injury. Ophthalmic diseases: Sympathetic ophthalmia, temporal arteritis, uveitis, and ocular inflammatory conditions unresponsive to topical corticosteroids. Renal diseases: To induce a diuresis or remission of proteinuria in idiopathic nephrotic syndrome or that due to lupus erythematosus. Respiratory diseases: Berylliosis, fulminating or disseminated pulmonary tuberculosis when used concurrently with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy, idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonias, symptomatic sarcoidosis. Rheumatic disorders: As adjunctive therapy for short-term administration (to tide the patient over an acute episode or exacerbation) in acute gouty arthritis, acute rheumatic carditis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, including juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (selected cases may require low-dose maintenance therapy). For the treatment of dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@N/A@Adults: Usually, daily oral dosages of 0.5 - 10 mg are sufficient. In some patients higher dosages may be temporarily required to control the disease. Once the disease is under control the dosage should be reduced or tapered off to the lowest suitable level under continuous monitoring and observation of the patient. For a short dexamethasone suppression test, 1mg dexamethasone is given at 11 p.m. and plasma cortisol measured the next morning. Patients who do not show a decrease in cortisol can be exposed to a longer test: 500 micrograms dexamethasone is given at 6 hourly intervals for 48 hours followed by 2mg every 6 hours for a further 48 hours. 24 hour-urine collections are made before, during and at the end of the test for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids. Children: 0.01-0.1mg/kg of body weight daily.@@@@@@@Undesirable effects may be minimised by using the lowest effective dose for the minimum period, and by administering the daily requirement as a single morning dose or whenever possible as a single morning dose on alternative days. Frequent patient review is required to appropriately titrate the dose against disease activity. Adrenal cortical atrophy develops during prolonged therapy and may persist for years after stopping treatment. Withdrawal of corticosteroids after prolonged therapy must therefore always be gradual to avoid acute adrenal insufficiency, being tapered off over weeks or months according to the dose and duration of treatment.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@DEXAMETHASONE ACETATE@@@@@DEXAMETHASONE ACETATE||||@JENAPHARM@@@@@JENAPHARM||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Anaemia@Haematological Malignancy@Breast Cancer@@Supportive Care|Anaemia|Haematological Malignancy|Breast Cancer||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Corticosteroid@@@@@Corticosteroid||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@100@1.1511@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@TABLET@EURO@@@@@@@@1.5@MG@1.5 MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Dosage recommendations may be converted from those in terms of bodyweight to those related to surface area by means of nomograms, as presented in Documenta Geigy. 1) Remission induction: a) Continuous treatment: i) Rapid injection  2 mg/kg/day is a judicious starting dose. Administer for 10 days. Obtain daily blood counts. If no antileukaemic effect is noted and there is no apparent toxicity, increase to 4 mg/kg/day and maintain until therapeutic response or toxicity is evident. Almost all patients can be carried to toxicity with these doses. ii) 0.5  1.0 mg/kg/day may be given in an infusion of up to 24 hours duration. Results from onehour infusions have been satisfactory in the majority of patients. After 10 days this initial daily dose may be increased to 2 mg/kg/day subject to toxicity. Continue to toxicity or until remission occurs. b) Intermittent treatment: 3-5 mg/kg/day are administered intravenously on each of five consecutive days. After a two to nineday rest period, a further course is given. Continue until response or toxicity occurs. The first evidence of marrow improvement has been reported to occur 7  64 days (mean 28 days) after the beginning of therapy. In general, if a patient shows neither toxicity nor remission after a fair trial, the cautious administration of higher doses is warranted. As a rule, patients have been seen to tolerate higher doses when given by rapid intravenous injection as compared with slow infusion. This difference is due to the rapid metabolism of Cytarabine and the consequent short duration of action of the high dose. 2) Maintenance therapy: Remissions which have been induced by Cytarabine, or by other drugs, may be maintained by intravenous or subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg once or twice weekly.@EMA, June 1999@@@@@@Only physicians experienced in cancer chemotherapy should use Cytarabine for Injection USP.

Less serious toxicity includes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, oral ulceration, and hepatic dysfunction.

The difference in the rate of DFS between the two arms diminished, however, at 5 years to 40 percent (Thymoglobulin arm) and 38 percent (control), primarily due to the occurrence of late relapses among patients with CML in the Thymoglobulin arm. Acute grade II graft versus host disease (GVHD) developed in 6 (12 percent) patients treated with Thymoglobulin and 57 (55 percent) patients in the control group. Further, acute grade III-IV GVHD occurred in none of the patients treated with Thymoglobulin but in 31 (30 percent) in the control. A confounding variable here was that the thresholds to initiate GVHD therapy were Grade I GVHD in the Thymoglobulin arm and Grade II in the control.

In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922944@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Cytosar-U may be given by intravenous infusion or injection, subcutaneously, or intrathecally. Patients can tolerate higher total doses when they receive the drug by rapid intravenous injection as compared with slow infusion. This phenomenon is related to the drug's rapid inactivation and brief exposure of susceptible normal and neoplastic cells to significant levels after rapid injection. Normal and neoplastic cells seem to respond in somewhat parallel fashion to these different modes of administration and no clear-cut clinical advantage has been demonstrated for either. In the induction therapy of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, the usual cytarabine dose in combination with other anti-cancer drugs is 100 mg/m²/day by continuous IV infusion (Days 1-7) or 100 mg/m² IV every 12 hours (Days 1-7). Cytosar-U has been used intrathecally in acute leukemia in doses ranging from 5 mg/m² to 75 mg/m² of body surface area. The frequency of administration varied from once a day for 4 days to once every 4 days. The most frequently used dose was 30 mg/m² every 4 days until cerebrospinal fluid findings were normal, followed by one additional treatment. The dosage schedule is usually governed by the type and severity of central nervous system manifestations and the response to previous therapy.@@@@@@@Only physicians experienced in cancer chemotherapy should use Cytarabine for Injection USP.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.

Peak plasma concentrations of about 30ng/ml are attained approximately 1.5 hours after an 8mg dose. For doses above 8mg the increase in ondansetron systemic exposure with dose is greater than proportional; this may reflect some reduction in first pass metabolism at higher oral doses. Bioavailability, following oral administration, is slightly enhanced by the presence of food but unaffected by antacids. Studies in healthy elderly volunteers have shown slight, but clinically insignificant, age-related increases in both oral bioavailability (65%) and half-life (5 hours) of ondansetron.

The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells.

This metabolite is believed to be responsible for the reduction of the cumulative renal toxicity of cisplatin and for the reduction of the toxic effects of radiation on normal oral tissues. The ability of Ethyol to differentially protect normal tissues is attributed to the higher capillary alkaline phosphatase activity, higher pH and better vascularity of normal tissues relative to tumor tissue, which results in a more rapid generation of the active thiol metabolite as well as a higher rate constant for uptake into cells. The higher concentration of the thiol metabolite in normal tissues is available to bind to, and thereby detoxify, reactive metabolites of cisplatin.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919786@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@NYCOMED@@@@@NYCOMED||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@MATRIFEN@@@@@MATRIFEN||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@4@1.1511@66.64@95.24@69.44@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@16.66@16.66@7330812@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) according to the 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WG Guidelines for Tumor Response as evaluated by an independent review committee (IRC). Duration of response (DOR) was an additional outcome measure.  The trial enrolled 106 patients who had received at least one prior therapy with 17p deletion, as detected by an FDA-approved CLL fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe kit.  Patients had a median of 2.5 prior treatments (range 1-10). The ORR by IRC was 80% (95% CI: 71%, 87%) with 8% complete remission (including 2% complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery).  Minimal residual disease (MRD) was evaluated in peripheral blood and bone marrow for patients who achieved CR or CRi, following treatment with venetoclax.  Three percent of the patients in the intent-to-treat population achieved a complete remission (CR or CRi) and were also negative for MRD in the bone marrow and peripheral blood.  The median time to first response was 0.8 months (range: 0.1 to 8.1 months).  Median duration of response (DOR) has not been reached with approximately 12 months median follow-up.

The most common (greater than or equal to 20%) adverse reactions of any grade were neutropenia, diarrhea, nausea, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 44% of patients, and the most common (greater than or equal to 2%) serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, pyrexia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, anemia, and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Due to a rapid reduction in tumor volume, TLS is an important identified risk when initiating venetoclax. The risk of TLS is reduced with stratification by tumor burden, prophylaxis with hydration and anti-hyperuricemics, frequent blood chemistry monitoring and correction of electrolyte abnormalities. In patients with higher risk features, hospitalization for IV hydration, electrolyte monitoring, and aggressive correction of electrolyte abnormalities may be required. In 66 patients with CLL starting with a daily dose of 20 mg and increasing over 5 weeks to a daily dose of 400 mg, the rate of TLS was 6% with no clinical events.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14916920@• Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity: Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia • Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer or multiple myeloma • Paget's disease of bone.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@392@Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia; please see label for dosing ranges; the total dose of pamidronate disodium may be administered either in a single infusion or in multiple infusions over 2-4 consecutive days.

Naturally occurring GnRH binds to the GnRH receptor on cells in the pituitary gland, triggering the production of luteinising hormone (LH), which subsequently stimulates the production of testosterone.  Both GnRH agonists and blockers bind to this same receptor target. Agonists work initially by stimulating release of LH and hence testosterone production, but blockers, like degarelix, directly prevent the release of LH, which means there is no surge in testosterone at the start of treatment leading to characteristic flare responses in symptoms and tumour growth.  With blockers there is no need to administer a second hormonal agent, called an anti-androgen, normally used to combat the flare responses that accompany the GnRH agonist usage.@@16162633@Indicated for treatment of adult male patients with advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer.@@NA@18-Jun-09@6/18/2009@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Japanese rights licensed to Astellas in January 2006@@NCT00295750@620@Starting dose: 240 mg administered as two consecutive subcutaneous injections of 120 mg eachMaintenance dose (monthly administration): 80 mg administered as one subcutaneous injection.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922096@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal.

14919577@Onco@@@@@300f1015ntsdm@@@@@@100 mg/m²@@L01DB03@L01D@YES@PARIS, FRANCE@@@Epirubicin is an anthracycline cytotoxic agent. Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919577@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in the growth and spread of several tumour types, with VEGF and PDGF overexpression linked to multiple cancers including cancers of the liver, lung, breast, kidney, bladder, ovaries, and colon. By inhibiting VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-kit pazopanib may stop or slow the rate of tumour growth and development. Pazopanib is currently being studied in a number of different tumour types; clinical trials are currently underway in renal cell carcinoma (Phase III), breast cancer (Phase III in inflammatory breast cancer), ovarian cancer, STS, NSCLC, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.

By inhibiting hypermethylation, Vidaza may restore normal expression to silent genes critical to cell differentiation and proliferation. Vidaza appears to exhibit its effects, inhibition of hypermethylation and direct toxicity, when cells are actively dividing.1 Because all cells are not in the same phase simultaneously, longer treatment time will expose more rapidly dividing cells to Vidaza. Vidaza also causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms.1 Cells that do not divide rapidly are relatively insensitive to Vidaza. @@14922166@High-risk MDS@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Nippon Shinyaku licensed Japanese rights from Pharmion in November 2006.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose.

Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917799@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma.

Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).

The binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some but not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance gene.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@ABZ PHARMA@@@@@ABZ PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@241.43@316.23@249.74@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@12.07@12.07@2239917@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

In postmenopausal women, oestrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens - primarily androstenedione and testosterone - to oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2). The suppression of oestrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Letrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the haem of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of oestrogen biosynthesis in all tissues.@@14917855@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive invasive early breast cancer.

Bevacizumab contains human framework regions and the complementarity-determining regions of a murine antibody that binds to VEGF (1). Bevacizumab is produced in a Chinese Hamster Ovary mammalian cell expression system in a nutrient medium containing the antibiotic gentamicin and has a molecular weight of approximately 149 kilodaltons. Bevacizumab binds VEGF and prevents the interaction of VEGF to its receptors (Flt-1 and KDR) on the surface of endothelial cells. The interaction of VEGF with its receptors leads to endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation in in vitro models ofangiogenesis. Administration of Bevacizumab to xenotransplant models of colon cancer in nude (athymic) mice caused reduction of microvascular growth and inhibition of metastatic disease progression.@@14921556@Stage IB-IIIA adjuvant squamous and non-squamous NSCLC@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@">> Roche reaches a friendly agreement to purchase the latter's outstanding shares at a price of US$95 per share.

In postmenopausal women, oestrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens - primarily androstenedione and testosterone - to oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2). The suppression of oestrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Letrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the haem of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of oestrogen biosynthesis in all tissues.@@14917851@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive invasive early breast cancer.

In post-menopausal women, oestrogens are produced primarily from the conversion of androgens into oestrogens through the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Oestrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for hormone dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, Aromasin p.o. significantly lowered serum oestrogen concentrations starting from a 5 mg dose, reaching maximal suppression (>90%) with a dose of 10-25 mg. In postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with the 25 mg daily dose, whole body aromatization was reduced by 98%. Exemestane does not possess any progestogenic or oestrogenic activity. A slight androgenic activity, probably due to the 17-hydro derivative, has been observed mainly at high doses. In multiple daily doses trials, Aromasin had no detectable effects on adrenal biosynthesis of cortisol or aldosterone, measured before or after ACTH challenge, thus demonstrating its selectivity with regard to the other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway. Glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid replacements are therefore not needed. A non dose-dependent slight increase in serum LH and FSH levels has been observed even at low doses: this effect is, however, expected for the pharmacological class and is probably the result of feedback at the pituitary level due to the reduction in oestrogen levels that stimulate the pituitary secretion of gonadotropins also in postmenopausal women.@@14916960@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogenreceptor positive early breast cancer who have received two to three years of tamoxifen and are switched to Aromasin for completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy; the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@SECOND-LINE@@4724@The recommended dose of Aromasin in early and advanced breast cancer is one 25 mg tablet once daily after a meal.

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that exposure of CLL lymphocytes to 2F-ara-A triggers extensive DNA fragmentation and cell death characteristic of apoptosis.@@14917928@Treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in patients with sufficient bone marrow reserves.

[Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@30@1.1511@4.82@17.08@5.67@@@@@@@@@@0.06@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@0.16@0.16@4939116@TABLET@EURO@@@@@@@@2.5@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@WINTHROP@SANOFI-AVENTIS@@@@WINTHROP|SANOFI-AVENTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@167.61@222.89@173.58@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@16.76@16.76@3981168@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

[Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@21@37.54@22.37@@@@@@@@@@0.42@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@2.1@2.1@6151421@SOLUTION FOR INJECTION (2 ML)@EURO@@@@@@@@5@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

14919570@Onco@@@@@300f1015ntsdm@@@@@@100 mg/m²@@L01DB03@L01D@YES@@@@Epirubicin is an anthracycline cytotoxic agent. Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919570@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

For high dose treatment, epirubicin may be given as an intravenous bolus over 3-5 minutes or as an infusion of up to 30 minutes duration. Breast Cancer: In the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer patients with positive lymph nodes, intravenous doses of epirubicin ranging from 100 mg/m2 (as a single dose on day 1) to 120 mg/m2 (in two divided doses on days 1 and 8) every 3-4 weeks, in combination with intravenous cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil and oral tamoxifen, are recommended. Lower doses (60-75 mg/m2 for conventional treatment and 105-120 mg/m2 for high dose treatment) are recommended for patients whose bone marrow function has been impaired by previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, by age, or neoplastic bone marrow infiltration.

Compounds of this chemical series are highly potent anticancer agents which are not susceptible to multi-drug resistance. Importantly, they appear to act by a mechanism distinct from other drugs that work on this molecular target, and have shown vascular disrupting activity. Microtubules play an essential role in cell division and thus drugs that interfere with the normal function of microtubules disrupt the life cycle of cells, ultimately causing  cell death.  There are currently three main classes of tubulin-binding drugs; colchicine analogues; vinca-alkaloids; and taxanes. While certain taxanes and the vinca-alkaloids are widely used anticancer agents, the acquisition of multi-drug resistance (MDR+) by cancer cells is a significant impediment to their ongoing clinical use.

In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems.

Bone marrow suppression, notably thrombocytopaenia and leukopaenia, which may contribute to bleeding and overwhelming infections in an already compromised patient, is the most common and severe of the toxic effects of BiCNU. Since the major toxicity is delayed bone marrow suppression, blood counts should be monitored weekly for at least 6 weeks after a dose. At the recommended dosage, courses of BiCNU should not be given more frequently than every 6 weeks. The bone marrow toxicity of BiCNU is cumulative and therefore dosage adjustment must be considered on the basis of nadir blood counts from prior dose. Pulmonary toxicity from BiCNU appears to be dose related. Patients receiving greater than 1400 mg/m2 cumulative dose are at significantly higher risk than those receiving less.

In clinical studies with a dosage of 12 mg/m2 daily for 5 days, patients who achieved a complete remission did so as a result of the first induction course.Combination Therapy: Mitoxantrone has been used in combination regimens for the treatment of acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL). Most clinical experience has been with mitoxantrone combined with cytarabine. This combination has been used successfully for primary treatment of ANLL as well as in the treatment of relapse. An effective regimen for induction in previously untreated patients has been mitoxantrone 10-12 mg/m2 IV for 3 days combined with cytarabine 100 mg/m2 IV for 7 days (by continuous infusion). This is followed by second induction and consolidation courses as thought appropriate by the treating clinician. In clinical studies, duration of therapy in induction and consolidation courses with mitoxantrone have been reduced to 2 days, and that of cytarabine to 5 days.

These cardiac events have occurred most commonly in patients who have had prior treatment with anthracyclines, prior mediastinal/thoracic radiotherapy, or in patients with pre-existing heart disease. The concomitant administration of other cardiotoxic drugs may also increase the risk of cardiac toxicity.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922202@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Novartis purchases Hexal and Eon Labs in a 5.65 billion euro deal.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@RESTRICTED SUBSTANCE PRESCRIPTION@SNS@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@JOHNSON & JOHNSON@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@JOHNSON & JOHNSON|JANSSEN CILAG|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@DUROGESIC MATRIX@@@@@DUROGESIC MATRIX||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1807@9.37@14.63@10.16@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/23/2017@1.87@1.87@662593@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MCG@25 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@217@Spain@@@@@@@@

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14920098@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal. Pamidronate disodium therapy in patients with Paget's disease has been effective in reducing serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels by = 50% in at least 50% of patients, and by = 30% in at least 80% of patients. Pamidronate disodium therapy has also been effective in reducing these biochemical markers in patients with Paget's disease who failed to respond, or no longer responded to other treatments. Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer and Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma: Pamidronate disodium is indicated, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy, for the treatment of osteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer and osteolytic lesions of multiple myeloma. The pamidronate disodium treatment effect appeared to be smaller in the study of breast cancer patients receiving hormonal therapy than in the study of those receiving chemotherapy, however, overall evidence of clinical benefit has been demonstrated.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Acquired through takeover of Merck KGaA's generics unit in May 2007@@@382@The recommended dose of pamidronate disodium in patients with osteolytic bone lesions of multiple myeloma is 90 mg administered as a 4-hour infusion given on a monthly basis.

Suggested dose adjustments include 125% from prior course if platelet and neutrophil counts are above 100,000 and 2,000 respectively; no adjustment if the counts are 50-100,000 or 500-2,000 respectively; and 75% if they are under 50,000 and 500 respectively.@@@@@@@Bone marrow suppression (leukopaenia, neutropaenia, and thrombocytopaenia) is dose-dependent and is also the dose-limiting toxicity. Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents. It can induce emesis, which can be more severe in patients previously receiving emetogenic therapy. The incidence and intensity of emesis have been reduced by using premedication with antiemetics.@LABEL@No@@Advanced ovarian cancer previously treated with chemotherapy@@@III@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@Carboplatin achieved 6 clinical complete responses in 47 patients.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918383@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@AWD PHARMA@@@@@AWD PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@120.5@163.33@124.99@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@12.05@12.05@822860@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14919537@• Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity: Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia • Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer or multiple myeloma • Paget's disease of bone.@@YES@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Via takeover of Mayne@@@382@Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in multiple myeloma - The recommended dose is 90 mg every 4 weeks.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose.

Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@KREWEL MEUSELBACH@@@@@KREWEL MEUSELBACH||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@237.26@310.96@245.44@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@11.86@11.86@3838117@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@75@MCG@75 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

A primary growth factor for erythroid development, erythropoietin is produced in the kidney and released into the bloodstream in response to hypoxia. In responding to hypoxia, erythropoietin interacts with progenitor stem cells to increase red blood cell (RBC) production. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is impaired in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), and erythropoietin deficiency is the primary cause of their anemia. Increased hemoglobin levels are not generally observed until 2 to 6 weeks after initiating treatment with Aranesp).

In the first, the use of darbepoetin alfa was considered over 25 weeks. The second included a time horizon of almost 3 years coupled with a treatment survival advantage (mean HR = 0.88). The associated ICERs for the two scenarios were approximately £160,000 and £24,000 per additional QALY gained, respectively.  In the base case of the Assessment Group's economic analysis, survival was assumed to be the same for both treatment and control arms (that is, a HR of 1 was used). This produced an ICER of more than £100,000 per additional QALY gained. The results of the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that erythropoietin analogues became more cost effective as the threshold haemoglobin concentration for initiating an erythropoietin analogue was reduced to lower levels, but the ICERs still remained high. The most favourable ICERs were obtained if a baseline haemoglobin concentration of 8 g/100 ml was assumed for all participants. These were in the range of £65,000–£80,000 per additional QALY gained.

Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

A primary growth factor for erythroid development, erythropoietin is produced in the kidney and released into the bloodstream in response to hypoxia. In responding to hypoxia, erythropoietin interacts with progenitor stem cells to increase red blood cell (RBC) production. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is impaired in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), and erythropoietin deficiency is the primary cause of their anemia. Increased hemoglobin levels are not generally observed until 2 to 6 weeks after initiating treatment with Aranesp).

In the first, the use of darbepoetin alfa was considered over 25 weeks. The second included a time horizon of almost 3 years coupled with a treatment survival advantage (mean HR = 0.88). The associated ICERs for the two scenarios were approximately £160,000 and £24,000 per additional QALY gained, respectively.  In the base case of the Assessment Group's economic analysis, survival was assumed to be the same for both treatment and control arms (that is, a HR of 1 was used). This produced an ICER of more than £100,000 per additional QALY gained. The results of the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that erythropoietin analogues became more cost effective as the threshold haemoglobin concentration for initiating an erythropoietin analogue was reduced to lower levels, but the ICERs still remained high. The most favourable ICERs were obtained if a baseline haemoglobin concentration of 8 g/100 ml was assumed for all participants. These were in the range of £65,000–£80,000 per additional QALY gained.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922951@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922942@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Little or no binding was observed in the non-lymphoid tissues examined.@@16749495@In combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL.@Both@YES@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@FIRST-LINE@NCT00281918@817@The recommended dosage of MabThera in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated and relapsed/refractory patients is 375 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 0 of the first treatment cycle followed by 500 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 1 of each subsequent cycle for 6 cycles in total.

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects. The differences in potencies for carboplatin and cisplatin appear to be directly related to the difference in aquation rates.@@14917230@Indicated for the treatment of: 1. advanced ovarian carcinoma of epithelial origin in  (a) first line therapy (b) second line therapy, after other treatments have failed. 2. small cell carcinoma of the lung.@@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@REIMBURSEMENT RANGES FROM 100% TO 70% DEPENDING ON SUB-POPULATIONS@@SECOND-LINE@@@Single-Agent Therapy: has been shown to be effective in patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma at a dosage of 360 mg/m2 I.V. on day 1 every 4 weeks (alternatively see Formula Dosing).

Angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in the growth and spread of several tumour types, with VEGF and PDGF overexpression linked to multiple cancers including cancers of the liver, lung, breast, kidney, bladder, ovaries, and colon. By inhibiting VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-kit pazopanib may stop or slow the rate of tumour growth and development. Pazopanib is currently being studied in a number of different tumour types; clinical trials are currently underway in renal cell carcinoma (Phase III), breast cancer (Phase III in inflammatory breast cancer), ovarian cancer, STS, NSCLC, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.

Naturally occurring GnRH binds to the GnRH receptor on cells in the pituitary gland, triggering the production of luteinising hormone (LH), which subsequently stimulates the production of testosterone.  Both GnRH agonists and blockers bind to this same receptor target. Agonists work initially by stimulating release of LH and hence testosterone production, but blockers, like degarelix, directly prevent the release of LH, which means there is no surge in testosterone at the start of treatment leading to characteristic flare responses in symptoms and tumour growth.  With blockers there is no need to administer a second hormonal agent, called an anti-androgen, normally used to combat the flare responses that accompany the GnRH agonist usage.@@16162634@Indicated for treatment of adult male patients with advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer.@@NA@18-Jun-09@6/18/2009@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Japanese rights licensed to Astellas in January 2006@@NCT00295750@620@Starting dose: 240 mg administered as two consecutive subcutaneous injections of 120 mg eachMaintenance dose (monthly administration): 80 mg administered as one subcutaneous injection.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918428@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@KREWEL MEUSELBACH@@@@@KREWEL MEUSELBACH||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@167.99@223.37@173.98@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@8.4@8.4@3837394@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@50@MCG@50 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism.

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects. The differences in potencies for carboplatin and cisplatin appear to be directly related to the difference in aquation rates.@@14919493@Indicated for the treatment of: 1. advanced ovarian carcinoma of epithelial origin in  (a) first line therapy (b) second line therapy, after other treatments have failed. 2. small cell carcinoma of the lung.@@YES@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Via acquisition of Merck KGaA generics unit@SECOND-LINE@@@Single-Agent Therapy: has been shown to be effective in patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma at a dosage of 360 mg/m2 I.V. on day 1 every 4 weeks (alternatively see Formula Dosing).

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14918211@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@7-Feb@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Via Sandoz@@@@Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated With Highly Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy: The recommended adult oral dosage is 24 mg given as three 8-mg tablets administered 30 minutes before the start of single-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@KREWEL MEUSELBACH@@@@@KREWEL MEUSELBACH||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@160.52@213.93@166.27@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@16.05@16.05@3840410@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs.

In post-menopausal women, oestrogens are produced primarily from the conversion of androgens into oestrogens through the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Oestrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for hormone dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, Aromasin p.o. significantly lowered serum oestrogen concentrations starting from a 5 mg dose, reaching maximal suppression (>90%) with a dose of 10-25 mg. In postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with the 25 mg daily dose, whole body aromatization was reduced by 98%. Exemestane does not possess any progestogenic or oestrogenic activity. A slight androgenic activity, probably due to the 17-hydro derivative, has been observed mainly at high doses. In multiple daily doses trials, Aromasin had no detectable effects on adrenal biosynthesis of cortisol or aldosterone, measured before or after ACTH challenge, thus demonstrating its selectivity with regard to the other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway. Glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid replacements are therefore not needed. A non dose-dependent slight increase in serum LH and FSH levels has been observed even at low doses: this effect is, however, expected for the pharmacological class and is probably the result of feedback at the pituitary level due to the reduction in oestrogen levels that stimulate the pituitary secretion of gonadotropins also in postmenopausal women.@@14916961@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogenreceptor positive early breast cancer who have received two to three years of tamoxifen and are switched to Aromasin for completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy; the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@SECOND-LINE@@4724@The recommended dose of Aromasin in early and advanced breast cancer is one 25 mg tablet once daily after a meal.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer. Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs (PDGFR, RET, or KIT) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRß- and VEGFR2-dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo.@@15338371@Well-differentiated pancreatic islet cell tumours@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Acquired through takeover of Pharmacia Corp., which acquired it from Sugen@@NCT00428597@340@@EMA, 2 December 2010@12/2/2010@10/7/2008@@@3/1/2007@@A6181111@No@JANUARY 2011 (NCE EXCLUSIVITY); FEBRUARY 2021 (GIST PATENT)@@@@III@APPROVED@@@HAUTE AUTORITÉ DE SANTÉ@Data from the trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed SUTENT more than doubled median PFS compared with placebo (11.4 versus 5.5 months, p<0.0001), which was found to be consistent in a blinded, independent central review of scans from the study (12.6 versus 5.8 months, p=0.000015).

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@-@-@@@-@DISCONTINUED@@-@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@-@@@@-@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@ESPARMA@@@@@ESPARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@-@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@-@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@5@1.3598@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@3/17/2015@@@2183252@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@50@MCG@50 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919353@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@AWD PHARMA@@@@@AWD PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@46.65@69.97@48.82@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@9.33@9.33@821406@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@75@MCG@75 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Both GnRH agonists and blockers bind to this same receptor target. Agonists work initially by stimulating release of LH and hence testosterone production, but blockers, like degarelix, directly prevent the release of LH, which means there is no surge in testosterone at the start of treatment leading to characteristic flare responses in symptoms and tumour growth.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

Many other regimens of intravenous and oral Cytoxan have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia. When Cytoxan is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose as well as that of the other drugs. Cytoxan and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of Cytoxan metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.@FDA, May 2000@@@@@@Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoproliferative malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically. Urinary System: Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal. Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Cardiac Toxicity: Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium. No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Infections: Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE||||@BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM@ROXANE@@@@BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM|ROXANE|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@Breast Cancer@Ovarian Cancer@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia|Breast Cancer|Ovarian Cancer||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@100@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@00054-8130-25@TABLET@US$@@@@@@@@50@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922935@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Maintenance dosage: Roferon-A should be given by subcutaneous injection three times per week at the maximum dose which is acceptable to the patient, but not exceeding 36 million IU. Patients with AIDSrelated Kaposi's sarcoma treated with 3 million IU of Roferon-A given daily showed a lower response rate than those treated with the recommended dosage.@Jul-99@@@-@@@Roferon-A should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the management of the respective indication. Appropriate management of the therapy and its complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. Patients should be informed not only of the benefits of therapy but also that they will probably experience adverse reactions. Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately. Psychiatric intervention and/or drug discontinuation should be considered in such cases. Ophthalmologic: As with other interferons, retinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis and optic neuropathy which may result in loss of vision, have been reported after treatment with Roferon-A. Any patient complaining of decrease or loss of vision must have an eye examination. Because these ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual examination prior to initiation of Roferon-A monotherapy or in the combination therapy with ribavirin is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922524@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922196@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Novartis purchases Hexal and Eon Labs in a 5.65 billion euro deal.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism.

Naturally occurring GnRH binds to the GnRH receptor on cells in the pituitary gland, triggering the production of luteinising hormone (LH), which subsequently stimulates the production of testosterone.  Both GnRH agonists and blockers bind to this same receptor target. Agonists work initially by stimulating release of LH and hence testosterone production, but blockers, like degarelix, directly prevent the release of LH, which means there is no surge in testosterone at the start of treatment leading to characteristic flare responses in symptoms and tumour growth.  With blockers there is no need to administer a second hormonal agent, called an anti-androgen, normally used to combat the flare responses that accompany the GnRH agonist usage.@@16392608@Indicated for treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer@@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Japanese rights licensed to Astellas in January 2006@@NCT00295750@620@Starting dose: 240 mg administered as two consecutive subcutaneous injections of 120 mg eachMaintenance dose (monthly administration): 80 mg administered as one subcutaneous injection.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14920117@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal.

Pamidronate disodium therapy has also been effective in reducing these biochemical markers in patients with Paget's disease who failed to respond, or no longer responded to other treatments.

In postmenopausal women, oestrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens - primarily androstenedione and testosterone - to oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2). The suppression of oestrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Letrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the haem of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of oestrogen biosynthesis in all tissues.@@14917854@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive invasive early breast cancer.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays.

Ibritumomab tiuxetan targets the antigen CD20 which is located on the surface of malignant and normal B-lymphocytes . During B-cell maturation, CD20 is first expressed in the midstage of B-lymphoblast (pre-B-cell), and is lost during the final stage of B-cell maturation to plasma cells. It is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalise on antibody binding. The conjugated antibody has an apparent affinity constant for the CD20 antigen of approximately 17 nM. The binding pattern is very restricted, with no cross-reactivity to other leukocytes or to other types of human tissue. [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin binds specifically to B-cells, including CD20-expressing malignant cells. The isotope yttrium-90 is a pure ß-emitter and has a mean path length of about 5 mm. This results in the ability to kill both targeted and neighbouring cells. Rituximab pre-treatment is necessary to clear circulating B-cells, enabling Zevalin to deliver radiation more specifically to the lymphomas.

Based on modeling studies, dasatinib is predicted to bind to multiple conformations of the ABL kinase. In vitro, dasatinib was active in leukemic cell lines representing variants of imatinib mesylate sensitive and resistant disease. Dasatinib inhibited the growth of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines overexpressing BCR-ABL. Under the conditions of the assays, dasatinib was able to overcome imatinib resistance resulting from BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, activation of alternate signaling pathways involving the SRC family kinases (LYN, HCK), and multi-drug resistance gene overexpression.@@14921923@Resistant or intolerant to imatinib; or Ph+ ALL@@NO@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@-@36@-@-@@@-@@@-@CA180031@@-@-@@@I/II@II@@-@@ASCO 2007; as of December 2006, 17 eligible patients have been treated in Phase I. 6 patients (4F, 2M; median age 43 y [range 27-56]) were treated with 50 mg BID and 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed (Grade 4 thrombocytopaenia). 2 patients experienced transient Grade 3 ALT elevations but as treatment was uninterrupted, these were not considered DLTs. 6 patients (6M; median age 42 y [range 27-55]) were treated with 70 mg BID and again 1 DLT was observed (Grade 4 thrombocytopenia).

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14918212@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Daiichi-Sankyo has agreed the purchase of a 34.8% stake in Indian generics giant Ranbaxy owned by the Singh family, and is seeking to acquire an additional 20% stake.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.

The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@MIBE@@@@@MIBE||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@FENTADOLON@@@@@FENTADOLON||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@92.6@128.06@96.22@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@4.63@4.63@1914469@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MCG@MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms.

Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses. Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: indicated in the management of selected adults with severe, active, rheumatoid arthritis (ARC criteria), or children with active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate. Combined use of methotrexate with gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or cytotoxic agents, has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects. Rest and physiotherapy as indicated should be continued.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Novartis purchases Hexal and Eon Labs in a 5.65 billion euro deal. [Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@66.32@94.84@69.11@@@@@@@@@@1.33@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@13.26@13.26@9218798@SOLUTION FOR INJECTION IN PRE-FILLED SYRINGE, 0.5 ML@EURO@@@@@@@@10@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922527@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects. The differences in potencies for carboplatin and cisplatin appear to be directly related to the difference in aquation rates.@@14919490@Indicated for the treatment of: 1. advanced ovarian carcinoma of epithelial origin in  (a) first line therapy (b) second line therapy, after other treatments have failed. 2. small cell carcinoma of the lung.@@YES@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@FIRST-LINE@@789@Single-Agent Therapy: has been shown to be effective in patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma at a dosage of 360 mg/m2 I.V. on day 1 every 4 weeks (alternatively see Formula Dosing).

This metabolite is believed to be responsible for the reduction of the cumulative renal toxicity of cisplatin and for the reduction of the toxic effects of radiation on normal oral tissues. The ability of Ethyol to differentially protect normal tissues is attributed to the higher capillary alkaline phosphatase activity, higher pH and better vascularity of normal tissues relative to tumor tissue, which results in a more rapid generation of the active thiol metabolite as well as a higher rate constant for uptake into cells. The higher concentration of the thiol metabolite in normal tissues is available to bind to, and thereby detoxify, reactive metabolites of cisplatin. This thiol metabolite can also scavenge reactive oxygen species generated by exposure to either cisplatin or radiation.@@14917732@Indicated to reduce the cumulative renal toxicity associated with repeated administration of cisplatin in patients with advanced ovarian cancer; to reduce the incidence of moderate to severe xerostomia in patients undergoing post-operative radiation treatment for head and neck cancer, where the radiation port includes a substantial portion of the parotid glands@@YES@@@NO REVIEW@@@@100%@>> Merck & Co and Schering-Plough have announced that their Boards of Directors have unanimously approved a definitive merger agreement under which Merck and Schering-Plough will combine, under the name Merck, in a stock and cash transaction.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922275@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@382@Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in multiple myeloma - The recommended dose is 90 mg every 4 weeks.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma.

Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@N/A@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@MYLAN@UDL LABS@@@@MYLAN|UDL LABS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1@103.95@@@@@@@@@@@@2.08@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/2/2017@5.2@5.2@51079-0670-05@TABLET@US$@@@@@@@@2.5@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

In combination with cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2 IV on day 1 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles) for previously untreated patients, 300mg/m2 IV on day every 4 weeks for 6 cycles should be used. Suggested dose adjustments include 125% from prior course if platelet and neutrophil counts are above 100,000 and 2,000 respectively; no adjustment if the counts are 50-100,000 or 500-2,000 respectively; and 75% if they are under 50,000 and 500 respectively.@@@@@@@Bone marrow suppression (leukopaenia, neutropaenia, and thrombocytopaenia) is dose-dependent and is also the dose-limiting toxicity. Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents. It can induce emesis, which can be more severe in patients previously receiving emetogenic therapy. The incidence and intensity of emesis have been reduced by using premedication with antiemetics.@LABEL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@@@@@@@CARBOPLATIN@@@@@CARBOPLATIN||||@APP PHARMACEUTICAL@FRESENIUS KABI@@@@APP PHARMACEUTICAL|FRESENIUS KABI|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Ovarian Cancer@@@@@Ovarian Cancer|||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Platinum@@@@@Platinum||||@@@@@@@@@@@ADVANCED@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@3.9@month@3.9 month@@@@1@1@27@@@@@@@@@@@@0.18@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/2/2017@27@27@63323-0172-15@SOLUTION FOR INJECTION - 15 ML@US$@@@@@@@@150@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

Bevacizumab contains human framework regions and the complementarity-determining regions of a murine antibody that binds to VEGF (1). Bevacizumab is produced in a Chinese Hamster Ovary mammalian cell expression system in a nutrient medium containing the antibiotic gentamicin and has a molecular weight of approximately 149 kilodaltons. Bevacizumab binds VEGF and prevents the interaction of VEGF to its receptors (Flt-1 and KDR) on the surface of endothelial cells. The interaction of VEGF with its receptors leads to endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation in in vitro models ofangiogenesis.

This metabolite is believed to be responsible for the reduction of the cumulative renal toxicity of cisplatin and for the reduction of the toxic effects of radiation on normal oral tissues. The ability of Ethyol to differentially protect normal tissues is attributed to the higher capillary alkaline phosphatase activity, higher pH and better vascularity of normal tissues relative to tumor tissue, which results in a more rapid generation of the active thiol metabolite as well as a higher rate constant for uptake into cells. The higher concentration of the thiol metabolite in normal tissues is available to bind to, and thereby detoxify, reactive metabolites of cisplatin. This thiol metabolite can also scavenge reactive oxygen species generated by exposure to either cisplatin or radiation.@@14920128@Indicated to reduce the cumulative renal toxicity associated with repeated administration of cisplatin in patients with advanced ovarian cancer; to reduce the incidence of moderate to severe xerostomia in patients undergoing post-operative radiation treatment for head and neck cancer, where the radiation port includes a substantial portion of the parotid glands@@YES@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Caraco is a subsidiary of Sun.@@@@For Reduction of Moderate to Severe Xerostomia from Radiation of the Head and Neck: The recommended dose is 200 mg/m2 administered once daily as a 3-minute i.v. infusion, starting 15-30 minutes prior to standard fraction radiation therapy (1.8-2.0 Gy).@FDA, 15 March 2008@3/15/2008@@@@@1. Limited data are currently available regarding the preservation of antitumor efficacy when Ethyol is administered prior to cisplatin therapy in settings other than advanced ovarian cancer.

Ethyol should not be used in patients receiving chemotherapy for other malignancies in which chemotherapy can produce a significant survival benefit or cure (e.g., certain malignancies of germ cell origin), except in the context of a clinical study. 2.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919654@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Sanofi acquired Sterling Winthrop in 1992.

However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

Increased clusterin production is observed in many human cancers, including prostate, non-small cell lung, breast, ovarian, bladder, renal, pancreatic, anaplastic large cell lymphoma and colon cancers and melanoma. Increased clusterin production is linked to faster rates of cancer progression, treatment resistance and shorter survival duration. Clusterin levels may be further increased in response to standard cancer therapies, including hormone ablation therapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Clusterin expression is linked to disease progression, treatment resistance, poor prognosis and survival in scientific publications. For example, increased expression of clusterin in prostate cancer is closely correlated with increasing Gleason score, which is a strong prognostic factor for poor survival of patients with prostate cancer.@@14925078@A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Phase 3 Study Evaluating the Pain Palliation Benefit of Adding Custirsen to a Taxane for Second-Line Chemotherapy in Men With Castrate Resistance Prostate Cancer@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@OncoGenex has decided to independently develop its lead cancer compound OGX-011, after amending a deal inked with Isis in 2001.

[clinicaltrials.gov]@@-@-@-@BASEL, SWITZERLAND@@@R7159 (GA101) is a novel fully humanized IgG1 type monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the extracellular part of the human CD20 antigen on malignanthuman B cells. The recognition of the type II epitope plus a modified, fully-human elbow-hinge sequence results in enhanced direct cell death induction and inhibition of proliferation. The Fcregion of the antibody was glycoengineered with GlycoMab technology. Consequently, R7159 also mediates enhanced induction of effector cell-mediated ADCC.R7159 constitutes the first type II CD20 antibody successfully engineered for increased ADCC, with significantly enhanced efficacy in a variety of in vitro and in vivo preclinical models. Roche presented preclinical data of GA 101 in B cell depletion essays with whole blood from healthy donors, which combined ADCC-, CDC- and cell death-mediated mechanism of actions. GA 101 was 25 times more potent in IC50 and 1.7 times in absolute B cell depletion versus rituximab. GA 101 also mediated superior cell death induction on a panel of patient-derived NHL B cells. In in vivo models of aggressive diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), ten out of ten mice showed complete tumor remission and nine out of ten showed long-term survival after treatment with 30 mg/kg GA 101 compared with 30 mg/kg rituximab.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer. Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs (PDGFR, RET, or KIT) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRß- and VEGFR2-dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo.@@15299334@Well-differentiated pancreatic islet cell tumours@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Acquired through takeover of Pharmacia Corp., which acquired it from Sugen@@NCT00428597@340@@FDA, 20 May 2011@5/20/2011@@@@3/1/2007@@A6181111@No@JANUARY 2011 (NCE EXCLUSIVITY); FEBRUARY 2021 (GIST PATENT)@@@@III@APPROVED@@@@Data from the trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed SUTENT more than doubled median PFS compared with placebo (11.4 versus 5.5 months, p<0.0001), which was found to be consistent in a blinded, independent central review of scans from the study (12.6 versus 5.8 months, p=0.000015).

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14921284@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation.

[Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration.

SOURCE: MIP@@-@-@-@-@@@Azedra is one of MIP's two lead radiotherapeutic product candidates under development for the treatment of cancer. Formerly known as Ultratrace MIBG, or I-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine, Azedra consists of an MIBG molecule radiolabeled by chemically binding to a radioactive iodine isotope through our proprietary Ultratrace technology. The iodine isotope, depending on the particular isotope selected, acts either diagnostically for imaging disease or therapeutically to deliver targeted radiation to the tumor site. Azedra incorporates an iodine isotope, targets specific tumor cells and does not contain unwanted carrier molecules, or cold contaminants. Cold contaminants are avoided using the company's proprietary Ultratrace technology. The company believes cold contaminants provide no therapeutic benefits, may provide unwanted side effects and compete with therapeutic MIBG for binding on target receptor sites, potentially affecting efficacy. I-123 MIBG containing cold contaminants is marketed in Europe and Japan for diagnostic imaging, but is not an FDA-approved product in the United States. I-131 MIBG containing cold contaminants is commercially available for therapeutic use in Europe but is not approved in the United States. The company believes that the Ultratrace technology provides Azedra with potential significant advantages over currently marketed I-131 MIBG containing cold contaminants. The Ultratrace technology enables Azedra to be an ultrapure compound, or a compound that is devoid of unnecessary cold contaminants.@@14924213@Malignant pheochromocytoma@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@-@37@-@-@@@FDA orphan drug and fast-track status@@@-@-@@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@There were 13 of 21 patients with at least three months of antitumor efficacy data available.

Tumor biomarkers, such as serum chromogranin A, 24-hour urine total metanephrines and 24-hour urine vanillylmandelic acid, correlated with reduction in target lesion size.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@HAUTE AUTORITÉ DE SANTÉ@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@JOHNSON & JOHNSON@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@JOHNSON & JOHNSON|JANSSEN CILAG|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@DUROGESIC@@@@@DUROGESIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1807@8.91@11.53@9.51@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@9/1/2017@1.78@1.78@3.40E+12@PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@2100@MCG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@85@France@@@@@@@@

Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately. Psychiatric intervention and/or drug discontinuation should be considered in such cases. Ophthalmologic: As with other interferons, retinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis and optic neuropathy which may result in loss of vision, have been reported after treatment with Roferon-A. Any patient complaining of decrease or loss of vision must have an eye examination.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

The effects of perifosine on Akt are of particular interest because of the importance of this pathway in the development of most cancers, the evidence that it is often activated in tumors that are resistant to other forms of anticancer therapy, and the difficulty encountered thus far in the discovery of drugs that will inhibit this pathway without causing excessive toxicity. High levels of activated Akt (pAkt) are seen frequently in many types of cancer and have been correlated with poor prognosis in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma, gastric, hepatocellular, endometrial, prostate, renal cell, head and neck cancers and hematological malignancies, as well as glioblastoma. The majority of tumors expressing high levels of pAkt were high-grade, advanced stage or had other features associated with poor prognosis. High pAkt is often seen in tumors that are resistant to conventional cancer treatments, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and especially therapy with some of the newer biologicals. Published data suggest that the Akt pathway is frequently activated in renal cell cancer and that this tumor type may be particularly responsive to Akt inhibition.@@14925077@A Phase III Randomized Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Perifosine Plus Capecitabine Versus Placebo Plus Capecitabine in Patients With Refractory Advanced Colorectal Cancer@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Keryx receives notice from Nasdaq that the company is not in compliance with the US$1 minimum bid price for continued listing and most reach this within 180 days.

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14921336@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole.

Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation.

[Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Leukemia: When used for induction, methotrexate in doses of 3.3 mg/m2 in combination with 60 mg/m2 of prednisone, given daily, produced remissions in 50% of patients treated, usually within a period of 4 to 6 weeks. Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors.

Like other glucocorticoids, dexamethasone also has anti-allergic, antipyretic and immunosuppressive properties. Dexamethasone has practically no water and salt-retaining properties and is, therefore, particularly suitable for the use in patients with cardiac failure or hypertension. Because of its long biological half-life (36-54 hours), dexamethasone is especially suitable in conditions where continuous glucocorticoid action is desired.@@14918695@Dexamethasone Injection is indicated in acute conditions in which oral glucocorticoid therapy is not feasible such as: Shock: of haemorrhagic, traumatic, surgical or septic origin; cerebral oedema associated with cerebral neoplasm; inflammatory diseases of joints and soft tissue such as rheumatoid arthritis. Short term management of acute self-limited allergic conditions such as angioneurotic oedema or acute exacerbations of chronic allergic disorders such as bronchial asthma or serum sickness. High doses of dexamethasone are intended for the adjunctive treatment of shock where massive doses of corticosteroids are needed.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918498@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@TAD Pharma was created in 2008 following the merger of Krka's Munich and Frankfurt subsidiaries.@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@TAD PHARMA@KRKA@@@@TAD PHARMA|KRKA|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@117.54@159.59@121.94@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@11.75@11.75@503155@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919581@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

By inhibiting hypermethylation, Vidaza may restore normal expression to silent genes critical to cell differentiation and proliferation. Vidaza appears to exhibit its effects, inhibition of hypermethylation and direct toxicity, when cells are actively dividing.1 Because all cells are not in the same phase simultaneously, longer treatment time will expose more rapidly dividing cells to Vidaza.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors.

A rest period of at least two weeks is recommended between treatments, in order to allow the bone marrow to return to normal. Doses in excess of 100 mg are usually given parenterally, when the injectable preparation should be used. Doses in excess of 70 mg/m2 should not be administered without leucovorin rescue (folinic acid rescue) or assay of serum methotrexate levels 24 - 48 hours after dosing. If methotrexate is administered in combination chemotherapy regimens, the dosage should be reduced, taking into consideration any overlapping toxicity of the other drug components.@@@@@@@Methotrexate should be used with extreme caution in patients with haematological depression, renal impairment, diarrhoea, ulcerative disorders of the GI tract and psychiatric disorders. Hepatic toxicity has been observed, usually associated with chronic hepatic disease. Renal lesions may develop if the urinary flow is impeded and urinary pH is low, especially if large doses have been administered. The administration of low doses of methotrexate for prolonged periods may give rise, in particular, to hepatic toxicity.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918366@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@ACTAVIS@@@@@ACTAVIS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@69.78@99.21@72.68@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@3.49@3.49@4682522@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MCG@25 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

In post-menopausal women, oestrogens are produced primarily from the conversion of androgens into oestrogens through the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Oestrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for hormone dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, Aromasin p.o. significantly lowered serum oestrogen concentrations starting from a 5 mg dose, reaching maximal suppression (>90%) with a dose of 10-25 mg. In postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with the 25 mg daily dose, whole body aromatization was reduced by 98%. Exemestane does not possess any progestogenic or oestrogenic activity. A slight androgenic activity, probably due to the 17-hydro derivative, has been observed mainly at high doses. In multiple daily doses trials, Aromasin had no detectable effects on adrenal biosynthesis of cortisol or aldosterone, measured before or after ACTH challenge, thus demonstrating its selectivity with regard to the other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway. Glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid replacements are therefore not needed. A non dose-dependent slight increase in serum LH and FSH levels has been observed even at low doses: this effect is, however, expected for the pharmacological class and is probably the result of feedback at the pituitary level due to the reduction in oestrogen levels that stimulate the pituitary secretion of gonadotropins also in postmenopausal women.@@14916943@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogenreceptor positive early breast cancer who have received two to three years of tamoxifen and are switched to Aromasin for completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy; the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy.@@NO@@@@@@@100%@@SECOND-LINE@@769@The recommended dose of Aromasin in early and advanced breast cancer is one 25 mg tablet once daily after a meal.

Tumor destruction and safety was shown in patients with diverse cancer types in three Phase I trials; treated patients were end-stage and had no effective therapies available. JX-594 multiplies selectively within cancer cells, leading to their destruction. These newly created copies of JX-594 are then released and are able to infect and eradicate other tumor cells both locally and in distant sites in the body. This cycle of JX-594 replication, cancer cell destruction, release and spread is then repeated. Normal cells are not affected by JX-594 resulting in safety and tolerability. The poxvirus strain backbone of JX-594 has been used safely in millions of people as part of a worldwide vaccination program against smallpox. This strain naturally targets cancer cells due to common genetic defects in cancer cells. JX-594 was engineered to enhance this natural safety and cancer-selectivity by deleting its thymidine kinase (TK) gene, thus making it dependent on the cellular TK expressed at persistently high levels in cancer cells. To enhance product efficacy, JX-594 is also engineered to express the GM-CSF protein. GM-CSF complements the cancer cell lysis work of the product candidate, leading to a cascade of events resulting in tumor necrosis, tumor vasculature shutdown and an anti-tumoral immune attack. @@14920929@Unresectable malignant melanoma@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Jennerex Biotherapeutics announced an agreement with Green Cross Corp., South Korea for the development and commercialization in Korea of JX-594 , an oncolytic vaccinia virus for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) as the initial indication.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents.

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that exposure of CLL lymphocytes to 2F-ara-A triggers extensive DNA fragmentation and cell death characteristic of apoptosis.@@14917914@Treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in patients with sufficient bone marrow reserves.

A lower initial dosage (12 mg/m2 or less) is recommended for patients with inadequate bone marrow reserves e.g. due to prior chemotherapy or poor general condition.

Reference should be made to the published literature for information on dosage modifications and administration. Mitoxantrone has also been used in various combinations for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, however data are presently limited and specific regimens cannot be recommended. As a guide, when mitoxantrone is used in combination chemotherapy with another myelosuppressive agent, the initial dose of mitoxantrone should be reduced by 2-4 mg/m2 below the doses recommended for single agent use.

Naturally occurring GnRH binds to the GnRH receptor on cells in the pituitary gland, triggering the production of luteinising hormone (LH), which subsequently stimulates the production of testosterone.  Both GnRH agonists and blockers bind to this same receptor target. Agonists work initially by stimulating release of LH and hence testosterone production, but blockers, like degarelix, directly prevent the release of LH, which means there is no surge in testosterone at the start of treatment leading to characteristic flare responses in symptoms and tumour growth.  With blockers there is no need to administer a second hormonal agent, called an anti-androgen, normally used to combat the flare responses that accompany the GnRH agonist usage.@@16162643@Indicated for treatment of patients with prostate cancer in whom androgen deprivation is warranted.@@NO@1-Sep-13@9/1/2013@NO REVIEW@@@@100%@Japanese rights licensed to Astellas in January 2006@@NCT00295750@620@Starting dose: 240 mg administered as two consecutive subcutaneous injections of 120 mg eachMaintenance dose (monthly administration): 80 mg administered as one subcutaneous injection.

Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@WYETH@PFIZER@@@@WYETH|PFIZER|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@METHOTREXAT LEDERLE@@@@@METHOTREXAT LEDERLE||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1.1511@409.55@528.78@423.15@@@@@@@@@@0.08@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@409.55@409.55@3027347@SOLUTION FOR INFUSION@EURO@@@@@@@@5000@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38.

The precise mode of action as an antiemetic is not known. The serotonin 5-HT3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and are centrally located in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin can then activate 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal efferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. The effect of Anzemet in the management of cancer therapy induced nausea and vomiting is due to antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors on neurons either peripherally and/or centrally located.@@14916589@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including high dose cisplatin;  the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@MIBE@@@@@MIBE||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@FENTADOLON@@@@@FENTADOLON||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@80.84@113.19@84.09@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@16.17@16.17@1914535@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918451@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@RIEMSER ARZNEIMITTEL@@@@@RIEMSER ARZNEIMITTEL||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@PATCH, TRANSDERMAL@EURO@@@@@@@@75@MCG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@
