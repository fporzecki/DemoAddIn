Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer. Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs (PDGFR, RET, or KIT) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRß- and VEGFR2-dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo.@@14922377@First-line mRCC@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Acquired through takeover of Pharmacia Corp., which acquired it from Sugen@FIRST-LINE@NCT00267748@282@-@-@@@-@@12/1/2005@-@A6181065@@JANUARY 2011 (NCE EXCLUSIVITY); FEBRUARY 2021 (GIST PATENT)@-@@@II@II@@-@-@RESULTS PENDING@-@@@@MONO@SUNITINIB MALEATE@@@@@SUNITINIB MALEATE||||@PFIZER@@@@@PFIZER||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Kidney Cancer@Renal Cell Carcinoma@@@@Kidney Cancer|Renal Cell Carcinoma||||||||@SUTENT@@@@@SUTENT||||@TK Inhibitor@VEGF@PDGF@SCF@@TK Inhibitor|VEGF|PDGF|SCF|@TIME TO PROGRESSION@@@@@@@@@@METASTATIC@@@@@RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@PARALLEL ASSIGNMENT@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@-@@@@@@@@@-@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

In postmenopausal women, estradiol is produced primarily from the conversion of androstenedione to estrone through the aromatase enzyme complex in peripheral tissues. Estrone is subsequently converted to estradiol. Reducing circulating estradiol levels has been shown to produce a beneficial effect in women with breast cancer. In postmenopausal women, Arimidex at a daily dose of 1 mg produced estradiol suppression of greater than 80% using a highly sensitive assay. Arimidex does not possess any progestogenic, androgenic or oestrogenic activity. Daily doses of Arimidex up to 10 mg do not have any effect on cortisol or aldosterone secretion, measured before or after standard ACTH challenge testing. Corticoid supplements are therefore not needed.@@16387793@Adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor-positive early invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women who have received 2 to 3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@100%@@SECOND-LINE@@2579@The dose of Arimidex is one 1 mg tablet taken once a day.

14916575@Onco@@@@@300f1010ntsdm@@@@@@Reolysin IV escalating doses with standard docetaxel dose@@-@-@-@CALGARY, CANADA@@@Reolysin, a proprietary formulation of the human reovirus, has been demonstrated to replicate specifically in tumour cells bearing an activated Ras pathway. Activating mutations of Ras and upstream elements of Ras may play a role in greater than two thirds of all human cancers. Reolysin may represent a novel treatment for Ras activated tumour cells and some cellular proliferative disorders. Reovirus, an acronym for Respiratory Enteric Orphan virus, is generally believed to inhabit the respiratory and bowel systems in humans. Reovirus is found naturally in sewage and water supplies. By age 12, half of all children show evidence of reovirus exposure and by adulthood, most people have been exposed. However, the disease is non-pathogenic, meaning there are typically no symptoms from infections. The link to its cancer-killing ability was established after the reovirus was discovered to reproduce well in various cancer cell lines. Tumours bearing an activated Ras pathway are deficient in their ability to activate the anti-viral response mediated by the host cellular protein, PKR. Since PKR is responsible for preventing reovirus replication, tumour cells lacking the activity of PKR are susceptible to reovirus replication. As normal cells do not possess Ras activations, these cells are able to stop reovirus infection through normal PKR activity. In tumour cells with an activated Ras pathway, reovirus is able to freely replicate and eventually kill the host tumour cells. As cell death occurs, progeny virus particles are then free to infect surrounding cancer cells. This cycle of infection, replication and cell death is believed to be repeated until there are no longer any tumour cells carrying an activated Ras pathway available.@@14916575@-@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@-@N/A@-@-@@@-@@7/1/2007@-@REO-010@@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@Fourteen patients have been treated to date in the dose escalation portion of the trial and eleven patients are evaluable for response.

In postmenopausal women, oestrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens - primarily androstenedione and testosterone - to oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2). The suppression of oestrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Letrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the haem of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of oestrogen biosynthesis in all tissues.@@14922723@Preoperative Letrozole (Femara) in Combination With Avastin in Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer @@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00461773@40@-@-@@@-@@3/1/2007@-@609001793@@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@Trial registered.

NEUPOGEN containing rmetHuGCSF (filgrastim) causes marked increases in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within twenty-four hours, with minor increases in monocytes. In some severe chronic neutropenia patients filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and basophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia already prior to treatment. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dosedependent at recommended doses. Neutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. Following termination of filgrastim therapy, circulating neutrophil counts decrease by 50% within 1 to 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 to 7 days.@@15045783@Indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia. The safety and efficacy of filgrastim are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. It is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). In patients, children or adults, with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.5 x 109/l, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long term administration of Biograstim is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence and duration of infection-related events. It is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC less than or equal to 1.0 x 109/l) in patients with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other options to manage neutropenia are inappropriate.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@@EMA, 15 September 2008@9/15/2008@@@@@@@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@@@@@@@FILGRASTIM@@@@@FILGRASTIM||||@RATIOPHARM@@@@@RATIOPHARM||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Neutropaenia@@@@Supportive Care|Neutropaenia||||||||@RATIOGRASTIM@BIOSIMILAR@@@@RATIOGRASTIM|BIOSIMILAR|||@Immunotherapy@G-CSF@@@@Immunotherapy|G-CSF|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@477.87@615.16@493.62@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@95.57@95.57@6553013@SOLUTION - INFUSION FOR INJECTION@EURO@@@@@@@@300@MCG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

Activating mutations of Ras and upstream elements of Ras may play a role in greater than two thirds of all human cancers. Reolysin may represent a novel treatment for Ras activated tumour cells and some cellular proliferative disorders. Reovirus, an acronym for Respiratory Enteric Orphan virus, is generally believed to inhabit the respiratory and bowel systems in humans. Reovirus is found naturally in sewage and water supplies. By age 12, half of all children show evidence of reovirus exposure and by adulthood, most people have been exposed. However, the disease is non-pathogenic, meaning there are typically no symptoms from infections. The link to its cancer-killing ability was established after the reovirus was discovered to reproduce well in various cancer cell lines. Tumours bearing an activated Ras pathway are deficient in their ability to activate the anti-viral response mediated by the host cellular protein, PKR. Since PKR is responsible for preventing reovirus replication, tumour cells lacking the activity of PKR are susceptible to reovirus replication. As normal cells do not possess Ras activations, these cells are able to stop reovirus infection through normal PKR activity. In tumour cells with an activated Ras pathway, reovirus is able to freely replicate and eventually kill the host tumour cells. As cell death occurs, progeny virus particles are then free to infect surrounding cancer cells. This cycle of infection, replication and cell death is believed to be repeated until there are no longer any tumour cells carrying an activated Ras pathway available.@@14916573@Solid tumours such as pancreatic, lung and ovarian cancer refractory to standard therapy@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@-@30@-@-@@@-@@10/1/2007@-@REO-012@@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@">> Enrolment started.

This is necessary to minimise the possibility of infarction and haemorrhage in the tumour due to a rapid cytotoxic effect of mitotane. Shock, severe trauma or infection: Mitotane should be temporarily discontinued immediately following shock, severe trauma or infection, since adrenal suppression is its prime action. Exogenous steroids should be administered in such circumstances, since the depressed adrenal gland may not immediately start to secrete steroids. Because of an increased risk of acute adrenocortical insufficiency, patients should be instructed to contact their physician immediately if injury, infection, or other illness occurs. Patients should carry with them the card provided with the package leaflet indicating that they are prone to adrenal insufficiency and that in case of emergency care, adequate precautionary measures should be taken. Monitoring of plasma levels: Mitotane plasma levels should be monitored in order to adjust the Lysodren dose. It may be especially recommended in cases where administration of higher starting doses is considered necessary (e.g. in highly symptomatic patients) to reach the desired therapeutic levels more rapidly. The therapeutic window of mitotane lies between 14 mg/l and 20 mg/l. A dose adjustment may be necessary to achieve the correct therapeutic level and avoid specific adverse reactions.

In postmenopausal women, estradiol is produced primarily from the conversion of androstenedione to estrone through the aromatase enzyme complex in peripheral tissues. Estrone is subsequently converted to estradiol. Reducing circulating estradiol levels has been shown to produce a beneficial effect in women with breast cancer. In postmenopausal women, Arimidex at a daily dose of 1 mg produced estradiol suppression of greater than 80% using a highly sensitive assay.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

The compound has a high lipophilicity which results in an increased rate of cellular uptake compared with doxorubicin and daunorubicin. Idarubicin has been shown to have a higher potency with respect to daunorubicin and to be an effective agent against murine leukaemia and lymphomas both by i.v. and oral routes. Studies in-vitro on human and murine anthracycline-resistant cells have shown a lower degree of cross-resistance for idarubicin compared with doxorubicin and daunorubicin. Cardiotoxicity studies in animals have indicated that idarubicin has a better therapeutic index than daunorubicin and doxorubicin. The main metabolite, idarubicinol, has shown in-vitro and in-vivo antitumoral activity in experimental models. In the rat, idarubicinol, administered at the same doses as the parent drug, is clearly less cardiotoxic than idarubicin.@@16624615@Acute myeloblastic leukaemia as a first-line treatment in paediatric patients.@@NO@25-Jan-17@1/25/2017@@@@@100%@@FIRST-LINE@@@The recommended dose is 10 to 12 mg/m²/day for 3 days@ANSM, 10 July 2015@7/10/2015@4/2/2007@@@@@@No@@@PAEDIATRIC@@@APPROVED@@ASMR V in paediatric patients [http://www.has-sante.fr/portail/upload/docs/evamed/CT-15601_ZAVEDOS_PIC_EI_LAM_pediatrie_Avis2_CT15601.pdf]@HAUTE AUTORITÉ DE SANTÉ@@@@@@COMBO@IDARUBICIN HCL@CYTARABINE@@@@IDARUBICIN HCL|CYTARABINE|||@PFIZER@@@@@PFIZER||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Myeloid Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Myeloid Leukaemia||||||||@ZAVEDOS@DEPOCYTE@@@@ZAVEDOS|DEPOCYTE|||@Cytotoxic Antibiotic@@@@@Cytotoxic Antibiotic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1.1511@23.6@31.23@25.18@@@@@@@@@@4.72@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@23.6@23.6@3.40E+12@CAPSULE@EURO@@@@@@@@5@MG@5 MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@85@France

EndoTAG-1 is a positively charged lipid complex which attaches itself selectively to the negatively charged cells lining newly formed tumor blood vessels. Thereafter, the lipid complex releases the cytostatic drug paclitaxel, in order to destroy the blood vessels and to cut off supply of the tumor tissue. MediGene believes that this targeted destruction of endothelial cells will not give rise to treatment drug resistance, a common problem of many current tumor therapies. In addition, it is expected that the mechanism of action of EndoTAG-1 will be broadly applicable and suited for the treatment of multiple types of cancer. In pancreatic cancer, tumor cells are known to be insensitive to treatment by taxanes such as paclitaxel. Therefore, this tumor type is well suited to test hypotheses of the specific mode of action of EndoTAG-1: if the tumor responds to treatment, the effect is caused by the vessel-destroying properties of EndoTAG-1 and not by the mere transport of the cytostatic drug to the tumor. However, in taxane-sensitive tumors such as breast cancer, the accumulation of paclitaxel in the tumor tissue is expected to show additional, direct effects on the tumor."@@14921646@Triple-receptor-negative breast cancer@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@-@-@-@-@NCT00448305@135@-@-@@@-@@@-@CT 4002@@-@-@@@EudraCT-Nr. 2006-002221-23; @II@@-@-@RESULTS PENDING; PHASE II DUE TO BE COMPLETED OCTOBER 2009@-@@@@COMBO@PACLITAXEL, LIPID COMPLEX@PACLITAXEL@@@@PACLITAXEL, LIPID COMPLEX|PACLITAXEL|||@MEDIGENE@@@@@MEDIGENE||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Breast Cancer@@@@@Breast Cancer|||||||||@ENDO-TAG-1@@@@@ENDO-TAG-1||||@Vascular Disrupting Agent@Angiogenesis Inhibitor@@@@Vascular Disrupting Agent|Angiogenesis Inhibitor|||@PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL@@@@@@@@@@TRIPLE NEGATIVE@@@@@RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@ACTIVE CONTROL@PARALLEL ASSIGNMENT@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Little or no binding was observed in the non-lymphoid tissues examined.@@14919096@Combo with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed by Mabthera monotherapy@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Roche announces US$43.7 billion proposal to assume full control of Genentech.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14919438@• Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity: Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia • Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer or multiple myeloma • Paget's disease of bone.@@NO@6-Aug@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in multiple myeloma - The recommended dose is 90 mg every 4 weeks.

Exogenous steroids should be administered in such circumstances, since the depressed adrenal gland may not immediately start to secrete steroids.

The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14920138@Management of breakthrough cancer pain in patients with malignancies who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Teva announces acquisition of Barr.

It is an active metabolite of folinic acid and an essential coenzyme for nucleic acid synthesis in cytotoxic therapy. Calcium folinate is frequently used to diminish the toxicity and counteract the action of folate antagonists, such as methotrexate. Calcium folinate and folate antagonists share the same membrane transport carrier and compete for transport into cells, stimulating folate antagonist efflux. It also protects cells from the effects of folate antagonist by repletion of the reduce folate pool. Calcium folinate serves as a pre-reduced source of H4 folate; it can therefore bypass folate antagonist blockage and provide a source for the various coenzyme forms of folic acid.@@14920842@Calcium folinate is indicated to diminish the toxicity and counteract the action of folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate in cytotoxic therapy and overdose in adults and children.

Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-strand breaks.@@14920169@Camptosar is indicated as a component of first-line therapy in combination with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin for patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum.

It is a peptide and therefore unrelated to the steroids. Chronic administration results in an inhibition of gonadotrophin production and subsequent suppression of ovarian and testicular steroid secretion. This effect is reversible on discontinuation of therapy. Administration of leuprorelin acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of gonadotrophins which leads to a transient increase in gonadal steroid levels in both men and women. Continued administration of leuprorelin acetate results in a decrease of gonadotrophin and sex steroid levels. In men serum testosterone levels, initially raised in response to early luteinising hormone (LH) release, fall to castrate levels in about 2-4 weeks.

Raloxifene's biological actions, like those of oestrogen, are mediated through high affinity binding to oestrogen receptors and regulation of gene expression.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

In recent years, it has been widely published that aberrant Hedgehog signaling may contribute to the growth of certain cancers, including basal cell carcinoma, breast, colorectal, esophageal, pancreatic, prostrate and small cell lung cancers, among others.  Curis' preclinical evidence suggests that Hedgehog protein produced by tumor cells may signal adjacent stromal cells within the tumor environment to produce various growth and angiogenic factors that can enhance tumor maintenance and growth. Systemic administration of small molecule Hedgehog signaling pathway inhibitors has been shown to slow or halt the progression of various types of tumors in our preclinical models of cancer.

[Protox]@@-@-@-@VANCOUVER, CANADA@9/1/2008@@Protox’s lead INxin drug, PRX321, is a novel protein comprised of interleukin-4 (IL-4), a protein that stimulates the immune system, in combination with Pseudomonas exotoxin. The IL-4 portion of PRX321 has been designed so that the molecule can bind with a very high level of specificity to IL-4 receptors on the surface of cancer cells. The IL-4 receptor is an attractive target since studies have shown it to be highly expressed in a large number of different types of cancer cells. The Pseudomonas exotoxin portion of PRX321 has been designed to minimize undesirable side effects by reducing its ability to bind non-specifically to cells containing the Pseudomonas exotoxin receptor. Once internalized into the target cell, the toxin component of PRX321 causes cell death by arresting protein synthesis and inducing apoptosis or cell death. The combined features of PRX321 allow for specific targeting to IL-4 receptors on the surface of cancer cells while retaining the high potency of the toxin component.@@14916625@Intratumoral Infusion of PRX321 in Subjects With Glioblastoma Multiforme at First Recurrence or Progression@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00797940@42@-@-@@@-@@2/1/2008@-@PRX321-1-05@@-@GBM at first recurrence or progression (i.e., disease progressed after any first-line therapy including surgery and radiotherapy as confirmed by MR imaging [MRI]); screening MRIs used to confirm eligibility must be available to the Investigator and the Independent Review Committee (IRC).@@@II@II@@-@-@Trial registered [Protox, 24.11.2008]@-@@@@-@-@@@@@-||||@PROTOX THERAPEUTICS@@@@@PROTOX THERAPEUTICS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Brain Cancer@Glioblastoma Multiforme@@@@Brain Cancer|Glioblastoma Multiforme||||||||@PRX-321@@@@@PRX-321||||@Other@@@@@Other||||@6-MONTH SURVIVAL@@@@@RESPONSE RATE@DURATION OF RESPONSE@PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL@@@RELAPSED@@@@@NON-RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@SINGLE-ARM@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@C$@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@49@Canada

Dose–limiting toxicity (thrombocytopenia) was observed in one patient at the 3.2 mg/kg dose and in two patients out of 14 at the 4.8 mg/kg dose. No objective responses have been seen at these dose levels. The maximum tolerated dose of GRN163L has not been established in this heavily pretreated patient population.

Obatoclax  is a pan-inhibitor of the pro-survival members of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators. Many of the cellular events that initiate malignant transformation of a normal cell (e.g., activation of oncogenes) also activate oncogenic stress pathways that usually cause the cell to self destruct by a process called apoptosis [3]. In order for these cells to survive and cause cancer, they typically must have acquired changes in other cellular pathways to prevent apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family of proteins are important regulators and executioners of the cellular decision to live or die. Moreover, this family of proteins also dictates whether or not many current cancer therapies are effective, because most of these treatments result in stress signals that ultimately must activate the cancer cell's apoptosis machinery.@@14921315@-@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00359892@29@-@-@@@-@@12/1/2007@-@GEM011@@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@Endpoint is over 4 weeks to 1 year.@-@@@@MONO@OBATOCLAX MESYLATE@@@@@OBATOCLAX MESYLATE||||@GEMIN X@@@@@GEMIN X||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Hodgkin's Lymphoma@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Hodgkin's Lymphoma||||||||@GX15-070@@@@@GX15-070||||@Bcl-2 Inhibitor@@@@@Bcl-2 Inhibitor||||@RESPONSE RATE@SAFETY@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@NON-RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@UNCONTROLLED@SINGLE-ARM@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@INTRAVENOUS@US$@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

The dose-dependent cardiotoxicity observed during anthracycline administration is due to anthracycline-induced iron-dependent free radical oxidative stress on the relatively unprotected cardiac muscle. Dexrazoxane, an analogue of EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid), is hydrolysed in cardiac cells to the ring-opened product ICRF-198. Both dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) and ICRF-198 are capable of chelating metal ions.

In somecancer cells, there is an overexpression of HDACs, or an aberrant recruitment of HDACs to oncogenictranscription factors causing hypoacetylation of core nucleosomal histones. Hypoacetylation of histones isassociated with a condensed chromatin structure and repression of gene transcription. Inhibition ofHDAC activity allows for the accumulation of acetyl groups on the histone lysine residues resulting in anopen chromatin structure and transcriptional activation.

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that exposure of CLL lymphocytes to 2F-ara-A triggers extensive DNA fragmentation and cell death characteristic of apoptosis.@@14919132@Relapsed B-cell CLL@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@>> Oral fludarabine is available for licensing in the U.S. market.

EndoTAG-1 is a positively charged lipid complex which attaches itself selectively to the negatively charged cells lining newly formed tumor blood vessels. Thereafter, the lipid complex releases the cytostatic drug paclitaxel, in order to destroy the blood vessels and to cut off supply of the tumor tissue. MediGene believes that this targeted destruction of endothelial cells will not give rise to treatment drug resistance, a common problem of many current tumor therapies. In addition, it is expected that the mechanism of action of EndoTAG-1 will be broadly applicable and suited for the treatment of multiple types of cancer. In pancreatic cancer, tumor cells are known to be insensitive to treatment by taxanes such as paclitaxel. Therefore, this tumor type is well suited to test hypotheses of the specific mode of action of EndoTAG-1: if the tumor responds to treatment, the effect is caused by the vessel-destroying properties of EndoTAG-1 and not by the mere transport of the cytostatic drug to the tumor. However, in taxane-sensitive tumors such as breast cancer, the accumulation of paclitaxel in the tumor tissue is expected to show additional, direct effects on the tumor."@@14921647@Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@SEPTEMBER 2005-@-@-@FIRST-LINE@NCT00377936@200@-@-@@@-@@@-@CT 4001@@-@-@@@EudraCT No.: 2005-000666-39; @II@@-@-@The 12-month survival rate of patients treated with Gemcitabine alone was 17%, while it was 22% (low dose), 36% (medium dose), and 33% (high dose) for patients receiving EndoTAG-1 in combination with Gemcitabine.

The effect on survival for TNCs appeared to reflect in part the patients' baseline prognostic factors. However, the CD54 upregulation ratio appeared to be an independent predictor of survival in patients who received Provenge as the correlation remained strong even after adjusting for baseline prognostic factors (p=0.022).

The effects of perifosine on Akt are of particular interest because of the importance of this pathway in the development of most cancers, the evidence that it is often activated in tumors that are resistant to other forms of anticancer therapy, and the difficulty encountered thus far in the discovery of drugs that will inhibit this pathway without causing excessive toxicity. High levels of activated Akt (pAkt) are seen frequently in many types of cancer and have been correlated with poor prognosis in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma, gastric, hepatocellular, endometrial, prostate, renal cell, head and neck cancers and hematological malignancies, as well as glioblastoma. The majority of tumors expressing high levels of pAkt were high-grade, advanced stage or had other features associated with poor prognosis. High pAkt is often seen in tumors that are resistant to conventional cancer treatments, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and especially therapy with some of the newer biologicals. Published data suggest that the Akt pathway is frequently activated in renal cell cancer and that this tumor type may be particularly responsive to Akt inhibition.@@14918971@-@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Keryx receives notice from Nasdaq that the company is not in compliance with the US$1 minimum bid price for continued listing and most reach this within 180 days.

In postmenopausal women, estradiol is produced primarily from the conversion of androstenedione to estrone through the aromatase enzyme complex in peripheral tissues. Estrone is subsequently converted to estradiol. Reducing circulating estradiol levels has been shown to produce a beneficial effect in women with breast cancer. In postmenopausal women, Arimidex at a daily dose of 1 mg produced estradiol suppression of greater than 80% using a highly sensitive assay. Arimidex does not possess any progestogenic, androgenic or oestrogenic activity.

Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia may be severe enough to cause death. Possible bone marrow depression requires careful monitoring of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelet levels. Such toxicity may necessitate temporary suspension or cessation of therapy. Hepatic toxicity, accompanied by hepatic vein thrombosis and hepatocellular necrosis resulting in death, have been reported. The incidence of such reactions has been low. This toxicity has been observed mostly when dacarbazine has been administered concomitantly with other anti-neoplastic drugs; however, it has also been reported in some patients treated with dacarbazine alone. Therefore frequent monitoring of liver size, function and blood counts (especially eosinophils) is required. It is recommended that dacarbazine be administered by physicians experienced in the use of cytotoxic therapy. Laboratory facilities should be available for blood monitoring. The drug can produce severe and possibly fatal, haematologic or hepatic toxicity and severe GI reactions and should be administered to patients preferably within the hospital setting, where they can be observed frequently during and after therapy, particulary with regards to the haemopoietic toxicity.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@FREE PRICE IN HOSPITAL@HAUTE AUTORITÉ DE SANTÉ@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@DACARBAZINE@@@@@DACARBAZINE||||@HOSPIRA@@@@@HOSPIRA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Hodgkin's Lymphoma@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Hodgkin's Lymphoma||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@@1.1511@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@EURO@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@85@France

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer. Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs (PDGFR, RET, or KIT) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRß- and VEGFR2-dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo.@@14922370@Adjuvant treatment of high-risk renal cell cancer@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Acquired through takeover of Pharmacia Corp., which acquired it from Sugen@-@NCT00375674@290@-@-@@@-@@7/1/2007@-@A6181109@@JANUARY 2011 (NCE EXCLUSIVITY); FEBRUARY 2021 (GIST PATENT)@-@@@III@III@@-@-@Endpoint over 2 years@-@@@@ADJUVANT@SUNITINIB MALEATE@@@@@SUNITINIB MALEATE||||@PFIZER@@@@@PFIZER||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Kidney Cancer@Renal Cell Carcinoma@@@@Kidney Cancer|Renal Cell Carcinoma||||||||@SUTENT@@@@@SUTENT||||@TK Inhibitor@VEGF@PDGF@SCF@@TK Inhibitor|VEGF|PDGF|SCF|@DISEASE-FREE SURVIVAL@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@RANDOMISED@DOUBLE-BLIND@PARALLEL ASSIGNMENT@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14919819@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@YES@@@NO REVIEW@@@@100%@@@@@Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in multiple myeloma - The recommended dose is 90 mg every 4 weeks.

Increased clusterin production is linked to faster rates of cancer progression, treatment resistance and shorter survival duration. Clusterin levels may be further increased in response to standard cancer therapies, including hormone ablation therapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Clusterin expression is linked to disease progression, treatment resistance, poor prognosis and survival in scientific publications.

By blocking these key pathways frequently over-expressed in a wide variety of cancers, enzastaurin suppresses tumor cell proliferation, induces tumor cell death and inhibits tumor-induced angiogenesis. Treatment has been well tolerated with minimal drug-related toxicity. Enzastaurin administration is associated with fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, decreased platelets, cough, vomiting, transaminase elevation, dyspnea, peripheral edema, and dizziness. Further testing in Phase III versus a placebo will provide us with a more complete look at the side effect profile for enzastaurin.

DNA synthesis is necessary for cancer cells to replicate; therefore inhibition of the ribonucleotide reductase enzyme can prevent cancer cells from dividing in the body. Disruption of DNA synthesis in some cancer cells will also cause their death. DNA synthesis is also involved in repairing damage to cancer cells that have been treated with many standard cancer chemotherapy agents. The ability of cancer cells to rapidly repair DNA damage caused by chemotherapy is one reason that cancer cells become resistant to standard anticancer agents. Because Triapine® inhibits DNA synthesis, it can inhibit DNA repair. Preclinical experiments conducted by Vion and Yale scientists have shown that Triapine can increase the antitumor effects of standard cancer agents such as cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide in mouse tumor models.@@14918755@Adenocarcinoma of the biliary ducts and gall bladder.@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00075504@78@-@-@@@-@@1/1/2004@-@NCI 6254  @@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@RESULTS PENDING@-@@@@COMBO@3-AP@GEMCITABINE@@@@3-AP|GEMCITABINE|||@VION PHARMACEUTICALS@@@@@VION PHARMACEUTICALS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Liver Cancer@@@@@Liver Cancer|||||||||@TRIAPINE@GEMZAR@@@@TRIAPINE|GEMZAR|||@Enzyme@@@@@Enzyme||||@RESPONSE RATE@SAFETY@PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL@@@PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL@@@@@-@@@@@OPEN-LABEL@NON-RANDOMISED@MULTI-CENTRE@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@US$@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14916857@• Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity: Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia • Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer or multiple myeloma • Paget's disease of bone.@@NO@2-Jan@@NO REVIEW@@@@65%@@@@@Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in multiple myeloma - The recommended dose is 90 mg every 4 weeks.

Activating mutations of Ras and upstream elements of Ras may play a role in greater than two thirds of all human cancers. Reolysin may represent a novel treatment for Ras activated tumour cells and some cellular proliferative disorders. Reovirus, an acronym for Respiratory Enteric Orphan virus, is generally believed to inhabit the respiratory and bowel systems in humans. Reovirus is found naturally in sewage and water supplies. By age 12, half of all children show evidence of reovirus exposure and by adulthood, most people have been exposed. However, the disease is non-pathogenic, meaning there are typically no symptoms from infections. The link to its cancer-killing ability was established after the reovirus was discovered to reproduce well in various cancer cell lines. Tumours bearing an activated Ras pathway are deficient in their ability to activate the anti-viral response mediated by the host cellular protein, PKR. Since PKR is responsible for preventing reovirus replication, tumour cells lacking the activity of PKR are susceptible to reovirus replication. As normal cells do not possess Ras activations, these cells are able to stop reovirus infection through normal PKR activity. In tumour cells with an activated Ras pathway, reovirus is able to freely replicate and eventually kill the host tumour cells. As cell death occurs, progeny virus particles are then free to infect surrounding cancer cells. This cycle of infection, replication and cell death is believed to be repeated until there are no longer any tumour cells carrying an activated Ras pathway available.@@14919011@Malignant melanoma@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@-@47@-@-@@@-@@5/1/2007@-@N/A@@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@Trial started.

The effects of perifosine on Akt are of particular interest because of the importance of this pathway in the development of most cancers, the evidence that it is often activated in tumors that are resistant to other forms of anticancer therapy, and the difficulty encountered thus far in the discovery of drugs that will inhibit this pathway without causing excessive toxicity. High levels of activated Akt (pAkt) are seen frequently in many types of cancer and have been correlated with poor prognosis in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma, gastric, hepatocellular, endometrial, prostate, renal cell, head and neck cancers and hematological malignancies, as well as glioblastoma. The majority of tumors expressing high levels of pAkt were high-grade, advanced stage or had other features associated with poor prognosis. High pAkt is often seen in tumors that are resistant to conventional cancer treatments, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and especially therapy with some of the newer biologicals. Published data suggest that the Akt pathway is frequently activated in renal cell cancer and that this tumor type may be particularly responsive to Akt inhibition.@@14916690@Chemo-insensitive sarcoma; (myxoid) chondrosarcoma or alveolar soft part sarcoma@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Keryx receives notice from Nasdaq that the company is not in compliance with the US$1 minimum bid price for continued listing and most reach this within 180 days.

Ibritumomab tiuxetan targets the antigen CD20 which is located on the surface of malignant and normal B-lymphocytes . During B-cell maturation, CD20 is first expressed in the midstage of B-lymphoblast (pre-B-cell), and is lost during the final stage of B-cell maturation to plasma cells. It is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalise on antibody binding. The conjugated antibody has an apparent affinity constant for the CD20 antigen of approximately 17 nM. The binding pattern is very restricted, with no cross-reactivity to other leukocytes or to other types of human tissue. [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin binds specifically to B-cells, including CD20-expressing malignant cells. The isotope yttrium-90 is a pure ß-emitter and has a mean path length of about 5 mm. This results in the ability to kill both targeted and neighbouring cells. Rituximab pre-treatment is necessary to clear circulating B-cells, enabling Zevalin to deliver radiation more specifically to the lymphomas. Rituximab is administered in a reduced dose when compared with the approved monotherapy. @@14916183@Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after 6 cycles of CHOP@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Schering AG licensed extra-U.S. rights from IDEC for US$47.5MIL in June 1999@-@NCT00440583@30@-@-@@@-@@9/1/2006@-@TH011101@@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@RESULTS PENDING@-@@@@COMBO@IBRITUMOMAB TIUXETAN@@@@@IBRITUMOMAB TIUXETAN||||@BAYER HEALTHCARE@CELL THERAPEUTICS@SPECTRUM PHARMA@RIT ONCOLOGY@@BAYER HEALTHCARE|CELL THERAPEUTICS|SPECTRUM PHARMA|RIT ONCOLOGY|@Thailand@@@@@Thailand|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@B-Cell Lymphoma@DLBCL@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|B-Cell Lymphoma|DLBCL||||||@ZEVALIN@@@@@ZEVALIN||||@mAb@Murine@Radiolabeled@CD20@@mAb|Murine|Radiolabeled|CD20|@PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL@@@@@@@@@@RELAPSED@REFRACTORY@@@@NON-RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@UNCONTROLLED@SINGLE-ARM@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@INJECTION@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

When bound to the polymer, paclitaxel is rendered inactive, potentially sparing normal tissue's exposure to high levels of the active drug and its associated toxicities. Blood vessels in tumor tissue, unlike blood vessels in normal tissue, are porous to molecules like polyglutamate. Based on preclinical studies, it appears that Opaxio is preferentially distributed to tumors due to their leaky blood vessels and trapped in the tumor bed allowing significantly more of the dose of chemotherapy to localize in the tumor than with standard paclitaxel. Once inside the tumor cell, enzymes metabolize the protein polymer, releasing the paclitaxel chemotherapy. Preclinical and clinical studies support that Opaxio metabolism by lung cancer cells may be influenced by estrogen, which could lead to enhanced release of paclitaxel and efficacy in women with lung cancer compared to standard therapies.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14919926@• Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity: Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia • Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer or multiple myeloma • Paget's disease of bone.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in multiple myeloma - The recommended dose is 90 mg every 4 weeks.

Although in vitro studies have demonstrated that vinflunine is consistently the least potent of the Vinca alkaloids, in vivo studies in a range of transplantable murine and human tumor models in mice have shown that vinflunine was markedly superior to vinorelbine and the other Vinca alkaloids in terms of increase in life span and inhibition of tumor growth. The potential of vinflunine as a component of combination chemotherapy has also been demonstrated. Preliminary evidence from phase I and phase II studies indicated that vinflunine was a promising anticancer agent with manageable toxicity, at least comparable in efficacy to the most active currently available agents. Antitumor activity has been observed in patients with advanced transitional cell cancer of the bladder, metastatic breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.

Ferumoxytol was more likely to increase baseline hemoglobin by =1 g/dl compared to oral iron (ferumoxytol 42.3% vs. oral iron 16.1%, p=0.0004). Increase in serum ferritin was significantly greater in the ferumoxytol group compared to the oral irongroup at Day 21 (ferumoxytol 551.0 ± 301.7 ng/ml vs. oral iron 8.9 ± 52.2 ng/ml, p<0.0001). Stratifying the EE population by ESP use, there was a significant difference in haemoglobinincrease for ferumoxytol compared to oral iron in both patients who were on ESP (ESP+) and those who were not (ESP-) (Table 6). At Day 35, mean hemoglobin increase in theESP+ group was 1.20 ± 1.54 g/dl for ferumoxytol compared to -0.12 ± 1.27 g/dl for oral iron (p=0.0015). Similarly, at Day 35, mean hemoglobin increase in the ESP- group was 0.70 ±1.01 g/dl for ferumoxytol compared to 0.15 ± 0.99 g/dl for oral iron (p=0.0038). ESP use in combination with ferumoxytol resulted in 61.0% (36/59) of patients achieving an increase inhaemoglobin of at least 1 g/dl compared to 16.7% (3/18) of patients on ESP and oral iron (p=0.0010).@-@@@@MONO@FERUMOXYTOL@@@@@FERUMOXYTOL||||@AMAG PHARMACEUTICALS@@@@@AMAG PHARMACEUTICALS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Anaemia@@@@Supportive Care|Anaemia||||||||@-@@@@@-||||@Imaging@Iron Therapy@@@@Imaging|Iron Therapy|||@HAEMOGLOBIN@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@OPEN-LABEL@RANDOMISED@MULTI-CENTRE@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@US$@@@@@@@@510@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

In breast cancer patients, at the tumour level, tamoxifen acts primarily as an antioestrogen, preventing oestrogen binding to the oestrogen receptor. In the clinical situation, it is recognised that tamoxifen leads to reductions in levels of blood total cholesterol and low density lipoproteins in postmenopausal women of the order of 10–20%. Tamoxifen does not adversely affect bone mineral density.@@14919774@@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90%@@@@N/A@Adults: The recommended daily dose of tamoxifen is normally 20 mg.

14918781@Onco@@@@@300f1018ntsdm@@@@@@N/A@@-@-@-@RICHMOND, AUSTRALIA@@@Cytopia has discovered a new class of orally bioavailable drugs that disrupt microtubule formation by interacting with tubulin. Compounds of this chemical series are highly potent anticancer agents which are not susceptible to multi-drug resistance. Importantly, they appear to act by a mechanism distinct from other drugs that work on this molecular target, and have shown vascular disrupting activity. Microtubules play an essential role in cell division and thus drugs that interfere with the normal function of microtubules disrupt the life cycle of cells, ultimately causing  cell death.  There are currently three main classes of tubulin-binding drugs; colchicine analogues; vinca-alkaloids; and taxanes. While certain taxanes and the vinca-alkaloids are widely used anticancer agents, the acquisition of multi-drug resistance (MDR+) by cancer cells is a significant impediment to their ongoing clinical use. CYT997 posesses in vivo efficacy in a several orthotopic models of solid tumor cancers and in a childhood t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia model, including a strong dose dependence demonstration of efficacy in a metastasising colon cancer model.

SOURCE: Fresenius/ASCO, 3 June 2008Most patients had late-stage disease with a median life expectancy of two to three months. The primary endpoint demonstrated that patients receiving removab had a four-fold increased puncture-free survival over a therapy with puncture alone (median 46 vs. 11 days, p<0.0001). The median time to the first therapeutic puncture, a key secondary endpoint, improved to 77 days in the removab group versus 13 days in the control group (p<0.0001). In contrast to the primary endpoint, patients who died before the next puncture were not included in this metric. The median TTP for the 170 patients treated with removab was 111 days, compared to 35 days for the 88 patients of the control group (p<0.0001). In the subgroup of patients with ascites from ovarian cancer, removab-treated TTP was also 111 days, compared to patients in the control group with 35 days (p=0.0002). In addition, patients with other primary cancers receiving removab also showed significant improvement in TTP, with a median of 110 days versus 34 days with puncture-therapy alone (p<0.0001). Median overall survival in the 170 patients in the removab group was 72 days, compared to 68 days of the 88 patients in the control group (p=0.0846). In a prospectively planned evaluation of 131 patients treated per protocol, a median survival advantage of 18 days was shown (removab: 86 days vs. control group: 68 days, p=0.0085). Removab treatment also showed a positive influence on the overall survival of ovarian cancer patients with a median survival of 110 days over 81 days for patients receiving puncture-therapy alone (p=0.1543). In patients with gastric cancer (the largest subgroup among patients with cancers other than ovarian cancer) the median survival advantage was 27 days (71 vs. 44 days, p=0.0313). After the primary end point of the study (puncture-free survival) was reached, the data showed that puncture intervals in patients treated with removab continued to be longer than those of the patients in the control group. The intervals between the first and second puncture were 26 and 24 days in the ovarian and non-ovarian cancer group treated with removab vs. 13 and 16 days in the control group.

Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell.

The product is currently in a Phase 2a study to evaluate NKTR-102 in combination with cetuximab. Irinotecan is an important chemotherapeutic agent used for the treatment of solid tumors, including colorectal and lung cancers. By applying Nektar's small molecule PEGylation technology to irinotecan, NKTR-102 may prove to be a more powerful and tolerable anti-tumor agent. Preclinical studies show that treatment with NKTR-102 results in significant suppression of tumor growth in an irinotecan-resistant mouse colorectal tumor model and in similar models of breast and lung cancer. Administration of NKTR-102 in an animal model also results in a markedly improved time-concentration profile for SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, as compared to treatment with irinotecan. Nektar PEGylation technology can enhance the properties of therapeutic agents by increasing drug circulation time in the bloodstream, decreasing immunogenicity and dosing frequency, increasing bioavailability and improving drug solubility and stability. It can also be used to modify pharmaceutical agents to preferentially target certain systems within the body. It is a technique in which non-toxic polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers are attached to therapeutic agents, and it is applicable to most major drug classes, including proteins, peptides, antibody fragments, small molecules, and other drugs. Nektar PEGylation technology is also used in eight additional approved partnered products in the U.S. or Europe today, including UCB's Cimzia for Crohn's Disease, Roche's PEGASYS for hepatitis C and Amgen's Neulasta for neutropenia. @@14924601@-@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@@@FDA grants orphan drug designation for NKTR-102 in ovarian cancer [Nektar, 21 April 2011, http://ir.nektar.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=571085 ] @@@-@-@@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@Trial to start in H2 2008.

Prolarix is a combinationtherapy of two low molecular weight compounds, a prodrug* (called tretazicar; previouslyCB1954) and an enzyme co-substrate* (called caricotamide; previously EP-0152R). Theprodrug tretazicar can be activated by an endogenous enzyme called NQO2, to a highlyreactive, short-lived cytotoxic agent which causes a high degree of DNA cross-linking. TheNQO2 enzyme is latent and therefore inactive in body tissue, but Protherics' scientists havediscovered that the enzyme is active in the presence of a co-substrate called caricotamide.The NQO2 enzyme is absent or in low levels in many normal body tissues, including bonemarrow, but its activity is increased in certain tumour types (particularly hepatocellularcarcinomas). The coadministration of the prodrug tretazicar and the cosubstrate caricotamideis therefore expected to result in the enhanced activation of the prodrug in the target tumourcells, resulting in their death whilst minimising harm to healthy, non-cancerous cells.@@14916656@Hepatocellular carcinoma@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00746590@20@-@-@@@-@@9/1/2008@-@PR003-CLN-pro001@@-@>>Subject must be at least 18 years of age. >>Subject must have a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of HCC and be considered unsuitable for resection or other potentially curative options (eg, liver transplant, curative radiofrequency ablation). >>Subject must have a measurable lesion by RECIST on CT scan in at least one site which has not received radiation or any other local therapy [eg, transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE), radiofrequency ablation, local injection].

Calcium folinate is frequently used to diminish the toxicity and counteract the action of folate antagonists, such as methotrexate. Calcium folinate and folate antagonists share the same membrane transport carrier and compete for transport into cells, stimulating folate antagonist efflux.

Hence, in some tumors, targeting both PI3K and mTOR may provide additional benefit compared with selectively targeting PI3K. XL765 is a potent inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR, and has shown attractive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and compelling anti-tumor activity in several preclinical xenograft models, both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy. Preclinical data presented at the 2007 AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in October 2007 demonstrate that XL765 inhibits PI3K pathway signaling in cellular assays and in xenograft tumor models. In addition, administration of XL765 results in the inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis, and of tumor cell survival in xenograft models. XL765 is orally available, exhibits durable activity in pharmacodynamic studies, and is well tolerated at doses that exhibit anti-tumor activity.

15045784@Onco@@@@@300f1012ntsdm@@@@@@@@L03AA02@L03A@@BERLIN, GERMANY@@@Human G-CSF is a glycoprotein which regulates the production and release of functional neutrophils from the bone marrow. NEUPOGEN containing rmetHuGCSF (filgrastim) causes marked increases in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within twenty-four hours, with minor increases in monocytes. In some severe chronic neutropenia patients filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and basophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia already prior to treatment. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dosedependent at recommended doses. Neutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. Following termination of filgrastim therapy, circulating neutrophil counts decrease by 50% within 1 to 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 to 7 days.@@15045784@Indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia. The safety and efficacy of filgrastim are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. It is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). In patients, children or adults, with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.5 x 109/l, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long term administration of Biograstim is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence and duration of infection-related events. It is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC less than or equal to 1.0 x 109/l) in patients with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other options to manage neutropenia are inappropriate.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@@EMA, 15 September 2008@9/15/2008@@@@@@@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@@@@@@@FILGRASTIM@@@@@FILGRASTIM||||@RATIOPHARM@@@@@RATIOPHARM||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Neutropaenia@@@@Supportive Care|Neutropaenia||||||||@RATIOGRASTIM@BIOSIMILAR@@@@RATIOGRASTIM|BIOSIMILAR|||@Immunotherapy@G-CSF@@@@Immunotherapy|G-CSF|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@754.95@965.48@779.43@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@150.99@150.99@6553036@SOLUTION FOR INJECTION OR INFUSION PRE-FILLED SYRINGE@EURO@@@@@@@@480@MCG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

It is effective in the treatment of advanced prostatic carcinoma. Estramustine has a dual mode of action. The intact molecule acts as an anti-miotic agent; after hydrolysis of the carbamate ester, the metabolites act to bridge the released oestrogens and exert an anti-gonadotrophic effect. The low level of clinical side effects may be due to the fact that estramustine binds to a protein present in the tumour tissue, so resulting in accumulation of the drug at the target site.

Genta's clinical trials programs focus on treating cancer patients with Genasense along with the administration of anticancer therapy with the intention of potentiating the cancer-killing effects of treatment. Genta is developing Genasense Injection with the intention of potentiating the cancer-killing activity of standard anticancer therapies. In a typical example, Genasense might be administered for several days and then be immediately followed by regular doses of chemotherapy. This sequence would then be repeated, depending upon the particular type of chemotherapy regimen and indication. In other applications, Genasense might be administered concurrent with or after conventional chemotherapy, again depending on the chemotherapy and indication.

It is a peptide and therefore unrelated to the steroids. Chronic administration results in an inhibition of gonadotrophin production and subsequent suppression of ovarian and testicular steroid secretion. This effect is reversible on discontinuation of therapy. Administration of leuprorelin acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of gonadotrophins which leads to a transient increase in gonadal steroid levels in both men and women. Continued administration of leuprorelin acetate results in a decrease of gonadotrophin and sex steroid levels.

Based on these updated results, the bias-adjusted prostate cancer rates are estimated to be 21.1% (4.2% high grade; placebo) and 14.7% (4.8% high grade; finasteride), a 30% risk reduction in prostate cancer [relative risk (RR), 0.70; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.64-0.76; P < 0.0001] and a nonsignificant 14% increase in high-grade cancer (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.96-1.35; P = 0.12) with finasteride. The estimates for high-grade cancer rates were 8.2% (placebo) versus 6.0% (finasteride), a 27% risk reduction (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.96; P = 0.02) with finasteride. The third analysis examined the impact of biopsy sensitivity on the risk relative of high-grade prostate cancer and found that differential sensitivity of biopsy between the treatment arms can have a significant impact on risk ratio estimates. These collective results suggest that the observed, unadjusted higher risk of high-grade disease with finasteride seems to have been due to facilitated diagnosis resulting primarily from increased biopsy sensitivity with finasteride. Therefore, men undergoing regular prostate cancer screening or who express an interest in cancer prevention should be informed of the opportunity to take finasteride for preventing prostate cancer.

NEUPOGEN containing rmetHuGCSF (filgrastim) causes marked increases in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within twenty-four hours, with minor increases in monocytes. In some severe chronic neutropenia patients filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and basophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia already prior to treatment. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dosedependent at recommended doses. Neutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. Following termination of filgrastim therapy, circulating neutrophil counts decrease by 50% within 1 to 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 to 7 days.@@15045780@Indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia. The safety and efficacy of filgrastim are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. It is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). In patients, children or adults, with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.5 x 109/l, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long term administration of Biograstim is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence and duration of infection-related events. It is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC less than or equal to 1.0 x 109/l) in patients with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other options to manage neutropenia are inappropriate.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@@EMA, 24 July 2008@7/24/2008@@@@@@@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@@@@@@@@FILGRASTIM@@@@@FILGRASTIM||||@RATIOPHARM@@@@@RATIOPHARM||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Neutropaenia@@@@Supportive Care|Neutropaenia||||||||@RATIOGRASTIM@BIOSIMILAR@@@@RATIOGRASTIM|BIOSIMILAR|||@Immunotherapy@G-CSF@@@@Immunotherapy|G-CSF|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@@1.1511@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@EURO@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@85@France

Compared to leucovorin, CoFactor creates more stable binding between the active form of 5-FU and the target enzyme, thymidylate synthase, or TS. CoFactor bypasses the metabolic pathway required by leucovorin to deliver the active form of folate, potentially allowing 5-FU to work more effectively. Inhibiting TS is a well-established and effective method of killing rapidly dividing cells, such as tumor cells. Inhibition of TS is most frequently accomplished through use of 5-FU, the metabolite of which binds to TS and disrupts cell replication.

The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells.

These enzymes catalyze the removalof acetyl groups from the lysine residues of proteins, including histones and transcription factors. In somecancer cells, there is an overexpression of HDACs, or an aberrant recruitment of HDACs to oncogenictranscription factors causing hypoacetylation of core nucleosomal histones. Hypoacetylation of histones isassociated with a condensed chromatin structure and repression of gene transcription. Inhibition ofHDAC activity allows for the accumulation of acetyl groups on the histone lysine residues resulting in anopen chromatin structure and transcriptional activation. In vitro, vorinostat causes the accumulation ofacetylated histones and induces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis of some transformed cells.

Raloxifene's biological actions, like those of oestrogen, are mediated through high affinity binding to oestrogen receptors and regulation of gene expression.

The increased of hydrogen peroxide over ambient levels can be eliminated by endogenous antioxidants and the only increased risk is for haemolysis in G6PD deficient and inherited anaemia patients.@@14924277@Management of plasma uric acid in adult patients with leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumor malignancies at risk for hyperuricemia and tumor lysis syndrome. @@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00230178@276@-@-@@@-@@4/1/2004@-@-@@16-Jul@-@@@IV@IV@@-@-@RESULTS PENDING@-@@@@MONO@RASBURICASE@@@@@RASBURICASE||||@SANOFI-AVENTIS@@@@@SANOFI-AVENTIS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@@@@@Supportive Care|||||||||@ELITEK@@@@@ELITEK||||@Detoxifying Agent@Urate Oxidase Enzyme@@@@Detoxifying Agent|Urate Oxidase Enzyme|||@-@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@PREVENTION@RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@ACTIVE CONTROL@PARALLEL ASSIGNMENT@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@US$@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT.
