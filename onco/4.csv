Panzem attacks tumor cells through multiple mechanisms of action (MOA) and blocks the development of new blood vessels that feed tumor cells. Panzem's MOAs include the disruption of angiogenesis through the inhibition of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1a), a protein required for angiogenesis and cell survival under stress. The inhibition of angiogenesis is an important approach to the treatment of both cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. Initial development of 2ME2 has been focused on various oncology indications. While modest antitumor activity has been demonstrated across most clinical studies, there is no clear development path that would allow the Company to narrow the indications for the next series of larger randomized studies. Panzem for oncology is a drug candidate that needs to be developed in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, requiring the conduct of further non-randomized trials to clarify specific combinations and indications. Conversely, Panzem has potential as a single agent in rheumatoid arthritis based on its antiangiogenic, antiiflammatory, and antiosteoclastic (bone resorption) properties.@@14924641@Metastatic docetaxel-refractory androgen-independent prostate cancer@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Entremed announces restructuring plan, including the loss of 60% of staff and core focus on development of ENMD-2076.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922060@• Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity: Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia • Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer or multiple myeloma • Paget's disease of bone.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia; please see label for dosing ranges; the total dose of pamidronate disodium may be administered either in a single infusion or in multiple infusions over 2-4 consecutive days.

Although in vitro studies have demonstrated that vinflunine is consistently the least potent of the Vinca alkaloids, in vivo studies in a range of transplantable murine and human tumor models in mice have shown that vinflunine was markedly superior to vinorelbine and the other Vinca alkaloids in terms of increase in life span and inhibition of tumor growth. The potential of vinflunine as a component of combination chemotherapy has also been demonstrated. Preliminary evidence from phase I and phase II studies indicated that vinflunine was a promising anticancer agent with manageable toxicity, at least comparable in efficacy to the most active currently available agents.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals. @@14916723@AD-923 compared to MSIR in CBP@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Sosei has taken back the commercialisation rights of the cancer pain treatment AD 923 from Mundipharma, having outlicensed the global markets except North America and Japan in June 2006.

Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38.

14921645@Onco@@@@@@@@@@@Endo-Tag-1 22MG/M2 twice weekly@@-@-@-@MARTINSRIED, GERMANY@@@"The concept of EndoTAG-1 is to ""starve"" the cancer through the targeted destruction of endothelial cells of the blood vessels supplying the tumor. EndoTAG-1 is a positively charged lipid complex which attaches itself selectively to the negatively charged cells lining newly formed tumor blood vessels. Thereafter, the lipid complex releases the cytostatic drug paclitaxel, in order to destroy the blood vessels and to cut off supply of the tumor tissue. MediGene believes that this targeted destruction of endothelial cells will not give rise to treatment drug resistance, a common problem of many current tumor therapies. In addition, it is expected that the mechanism of action of EndoTAG-1 will be broadly applicable and suited for the treatment of multiple types of cancer. In pancreatic cancer, tumor cells are known to be insensitive to treatment by taxanes such as paclitaxel. Therefore, this tumor type is well suited to test hypotheses of the specific mode of action of EndoTAG-1: if the tumor responds to treatment, the effect is caused by the vessel-destroying properties of EndoTAG-1 and not by the mere transport of the cytostatic drug to the tumor. However, in taxane-sensitive tumors such as breast cancer, the accumulation of paclitaxel in the tumor tissue is expected to show additional, direct effects on the tumor."@@14921645@Hepatic metastases in patients with a carcinomatous primary tumour other than HCC, biliary or bile duct carcinoma@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@NOVEMBER 2007-JUNE 2008@-@-@-@NCT00542048@20@-@-@@@-@@@-@CT 4003@@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@The median survival time of the group treated with the highest dosage of EndoTAGTM-1 increased by 30 % compared to the control group.

The total daily dose may be divided in two or three doses according to patient's convenience, and the treatment should be preferably taken during meals.@@@@@@@Before the initiation of the treatment: All possible tumour tissues should be surgically removed from large metastatic masses before mitotane administration is instituted. This is necessary to minimise the possibility of infarction and haemorrhage in the tumour due to a rapid cytotoxic effect of mitotane. Shock, severe trauma or infection: Mitotane should be temporarily discontinued immediately following shock, severe trauma or infection, since adrenal suppression is its prime action. Exogenous steroids should be administered in such circumstances, since the depressed adrenal gland may not immediately start to secrete steroids. Because of an increased risk of acute adrenocortical insufficiency, patients should be instructed to contact their physician immediately if injury, infection, or other illness occurs. Patients should carry with them the card provided with the package leaflet indicating that they are prone to adrenal insufficiency and that in case of emergency care, adequate precautionary measures should be taken. Monitoring of plasma levels: Mitotane plasma levels should be monitored in order to adjust the Lysodren dose. It may be especially recommended in cases where administration of higher starting doses is considered necessary (e.g. in highly symptomatic patients) to reach the desired therapeutic levels more rapidly. The therapeutic window of mitotane lies between 14 mg/l and 20 mg/l. A dose adjustment may be necessary to achieve the correct therapeutic level and avoid specific adverse reactions. Mitotane plasma levels higher than 20 mg/l may be associated with severe undesirable effects and offer no further benefit in terms of efficacy.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@MITOTANE@@@@@MITOTANE||||@HRA PHARMA@@@@@HRA PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Kidney Cancer@@@@@Kidney Cancer|||||||||@LYSODREN@@@@@LYSODREN||||@Other@@@@@Other||||@@@@@@@@@@@ADVANCED@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@100@1.1511@714.28@914.06@737.48@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@7.14@7.14@1296296@TABLET@EURO@@@@@@@@500@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

The dose-dependent cardiotoxicity observed during anthracycline administration is due to anthracycline-induced iron-dependent free radical oxidative stress on the relatively unprotected cardiac muscle. Dexrazoxane, an analogue of EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid), is hydrolysed in cardiac cells to the ring-opened product ICRF-198. Both dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) and ICRF-198 are capable of chelating metal ions. It is generally thought that they can provide cardioprotection by scavenging metal ions thus preventing the Fe3+-anthracycline complex from redox cycling and forming reactive radicals.@@14917223@Indicated for the treatment of anthracycline extravasation@@YES@5-May@@NO REVIEW@@@@100%@@@@36@Savene should be given once daily for 3 consecutive days.

If there is suspicion of extravasation by vesicant compounds other than anthracyclines through the same IV access, e.g. vincristine, mitomycin, and vinorelbine, Savene would not be effective against the reaction from these compounds. Savene will be administered to patients undergoing cytotoxic therapy with anthracycline containing chemotherapy and its cytotoxic potential (especially resulting in reversible haematological toxicity with a nadir occurring on days 11-12) will therefore be added to that of the other chemotherapy administered.

DNA synthesis is necessary for cancer cells to replicate; therefore inhibition of the ribonucleotide reductase enzyme can prevent cancer cells from dividing in the body. Disruption of DNA synthesis in some cancer cells will also cause their death. DNA synthesis is also involved in repairing damage to cancer cells that have been treated with many standard cancer chemotherapy agents. The ability of cancer cells to rapidly repair DNA damage caused by chemotherapy is one reason that cancer cells become resistant to standard anticancer agents. Because Triapine® inhibits DNA synthesis, it can inhibit DNA repair. Preclinical experiments conducted by Vion and Yale scientists have shown that Triapine can increase the antitumor effects of standard cancer agents such as cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide in mouse tumor models.@@14918754@Chronic myelomonotic leukemia or accelerated phase or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00335998@24@-@-@@@-@@2/1/2006@-@NCI 7704  @@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@RESULTS PENDING@-@@@@COMBO@3-AP@CISPLATIN@@@@3-AP|CISPLATIN|||@VION PHARMACEUTICALS@@@@@VION PHARMACEUTICALS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia||||||||@TRIAPINE@@@@@TRIAPINE||||@Enzyme@@@@@Enzyme||||@MAXIMUM TOLERATED DOSE@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@MULTI-CENTRE@DOSE ESCALATION@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@US$@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro. Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma.@@16446642@VELCADE, in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not candidates for high dosechemotherapy.@@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@FIRST-LINE@@@@@@@@@@@@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@NHI@@@@@@COMBO@BORTEZOMIB@MELPHALAN@PREDNISONE@@@BORTEZOMIB|MELPHALAN|PREDNISONE||@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@@JANSSEN CILAG||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Myeloma@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Myeloma||||||||@VELCADE@ALKERAN@GENERIC@@@VELCADE|ALKERAN|GENERIC||@Proteasome Inhibitor@@@@@Proteasome Inhibitor||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@1.75@m²@4594883.596@@@54@week@54 week@4594883.6@4594883.6@12155.78@1@0.0091@116522.83@137409@@@@@@@@@@@38840.94@42@4@mg/m²@1.3@8@42@@mg/m²@1.3@4@@@@@@8/30/2017@116522.83@116522.83@4291412D1024@INJECTION@YEN@@@@@@@@3@MG@3 MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@2017-09-15T09:28:17.5370353Z@121@Japan

Based on modeling studies, dasatinib is predicted to bind to multiple conformations of the ABL kinase. In vitro, dasatinib was active in leukemic cell lines representing variants of imatinib mesylate sensitive and resistant disease. Dasatinib inhibited the growth of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines overexpressing BCR-ABL. Under the conditions of the assays, dasatinib was able to overcome imatinib resistance resulting from BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, activation of alternate signaling pathways involving the SRC family kinases (LYN, HCK), and multi-drug resistance gene overexpression.@@14924722@Progressive advanced ER+/PR+ or HER2-positive breast cancer@@NO@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00371345@90@-@-@@@-@@12/1/2006@-@-@@APRIL 2020 ('746); PATENT EXTENSION FILED.@-@@@II@II@@-@-@Results expected in December 2008.@-@@@@MONO@DASATINIB@@@@@DASATINIB||||@BMS@@@@@BMS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Breast Cancer@@@@@Breast Cancer|||||||||@SPRYCEL@@@@@SPRYCEL||||@TK Inhibitor@bcr-abl@PDGF@@@TK Inhibitor|bcr-abl|PDGF||@RESPONSE RATE@@@@@@@@@@ADVANCED@@@@@NON-RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@UNCONTROLLED@SINGLE-ARM@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@US$@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States
16384689@Onco@@@@@300f1037ntsdm@@@@@@@@L01CD02@L01C@@PARIS, FRANCE@@@Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some but not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance gene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental antitumour activity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours.@@16384689@TAXOTERE is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy.@@YES@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@SECOND-LINE@@@For treatment after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m² as a single agent.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation.

The attractive safety profile and mechanism of action of obatoclax offers the opportunity to treat many forms of cancer as both a single agent and in combination with current treatments. Obatoclax  is a pan-inhibitor of the pro-survival members of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators. Many of the cellular events that initiate malignant transformation of a normal cell (e.g., activation of oncogenes) also activate oncogenic stress pathways that usually cause the cell to self destruct by a process called apoptosis [3]. In order for these cells to survive and cause cancer, they typically must have acquired changes in other cellular pathways to prevent apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family of proteins are important regulators and executioners of the cellular decision to live or die. Moreover, this family of proteins also dictates whether or not many current cancer therapies are effective, because most of these treatments result in stress signals that ultimately must activate the cancer cell's apoptosis machinery.@@14921316@-@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00405951@41@-@-@@@-@@10/1/2006@-@GEM010@@-@-@@@I/II@II@@-@-@RESULTS PENDING@-@@@@COMBO@OBATOCLAX MESYLATE@DOCETAXEL@@@@OBATOCLAX MESYLATE|DOCETAXEL|||@GEMIN X@@@@@GEMIN X||||@@@@@@|||||||||@NSCLC@@@@@NSCLC|||||||||@GX15-070@TAXOTERE@@@@GX15-070|TAXOTERE|||@Bcl-2 Inhibitor@@@@@Bcl-2 Inhibitor||||@MAXIMUM TOLERATED DOSE@RESPONSE RATE@@@@@@@@@RELAPSED@REFRACTORY@@@@NON-RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@UNCONTROLLED@SINGLE-ARM@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@INTRAVENOUS@US$@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro. Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma.@@16446637@VELCADE, as part of combination therapy, is indicated for induction therapy prior to high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue for patients under 65 years of age with previously untreated multiple myeloma.@@YES@12-Mar@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@FIRST-LINE@@482@VELCADE plus dexamethasone: VELCADE (bortezomib) is administered as an IV injection in combination with oral dexamethasone for four 3-week treatment cycles as shown in Table 21.@TGA, 30 November 2011@11/30/2011@@No@@@@@No@@@@@III@APPROVED@@The PBAC recommended listing as a Section 100 (Efficient Funding of Chemotherapy) Public and Private Hospital Authority Required listing for the treatment in combination with chemotherapy, of a patient with newly diagnosed symptomatic multiple myeloma who is eligible for high dose chemotherapy and a primary stem cell transplant on a cost-minimisation basis compared with thalidomide.@PBS@@@@@@COMBO@BORTEZOMIB@DEXAMETHASONE@@@@BORTEZOMIB|DEXAMETHASONE|||@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@@JANSSEN CILAG||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Myeloma@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Myeloma||||||||@VELCADE@GENERIC@@@@VELCADE|GENERIC|||@Proteasome Inhibitor@@@@@Proteasome Inhibitor||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@OPEN LABEL@MULTI-CENTRE@RANDOMISED@@@1.75@m²@16934.32@@@84@day@84 day@16934.32@16934.32@201.6@1@0.779@1628.3@@@@@@@@@@@@465.23@21@@mg/m²@1.3@4@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@1628.3@1628.3@3554-2615-IN-JC@POWDER FOR INJECTION@A$@@@@@@@@3.5@MG@3.5 MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@23@Australia

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).

Raloxifene's biological actions, like those of oestrogen, are mediated through high affinity binding to oestrogen receptors and regulation of gene expression.

[Viralytics]@@-@-@-@-@@@Cavatak is the trade name of Coxsackievirus A21 (CVA21). It is a human virus that occurs naturally in the community, and was first isolated over 50 years ago. Infection by CVA21 is often symptomless; when it does produce illness it is associated with a common cold-like illness. In order to infect a cell, CVA21 must first attach to the outside of a cell, using a specific ‘receptor' on the cell's surface (like a key fitting a lock). CVA21 uses two receptors to infect cells, ICAM-1 (Inter cellular adhesion molecule 1) and DAF (decay accelerating factor). These receptors occur in far higher numbers in metastatic melanoma cells than in normal cells. As ICAM-1 is not present to any significant extent on normal tissue cells, this confers a high degree of specificity on the oncolytic action of the viruses (ICAM-1 is also sometimes present in increased amounts in other cancer types, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer and multiple myeloma).@@14916047@Intratumoural Administration of CAVATAK to Head and Neck Cancer Patients@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00832559@9@-@-@@@-@@1/1/2009@-@VLA X-06@@-@"Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head or neck currently documented as ""progressive disease""; Head and neck cancer patients with more than one tumour mass where at least one tumour mass is accessible for intratumoural injection and both tumour masses can be measured at periodic intervals for tumour size using callipers, ultrasound, CT scans or other radiological methods; All patients to have histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (excluding nasopharyngeal) that had recurred or relapsed after surgery and/or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy for primary tumours."@@@I@I@@-@-@Trial registered and commenced [Viralytics, 29.01.2009]@-@@@@MONO@-@@@@@-||||@VIRALYTICS@@@@@VIRALYTICS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Head & Neck Cancer@@@@@Head & Neck Cancer|||||||||@CAVATAK@@@@@CAVATAK||||@Vaccine@@@@@Vaccine||||@SAFETY@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@OPEN-LABEL@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@23@Australia

Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-strand breaks.@@14920077@Camptosar is indicated as a component of first-line therapy in combination with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin for patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum.

Chronic administration results in an inhibition of gonadotrophin production and subsequent suppression of ovarian and testicular steroid secretion. This effect is reversible on discontinuation of therapy. Administration of leuprorelin acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of gonadotrophins which leads to a transient increase in gonadal steroid levels in both men and women. Continued administration of leuprorelin acetate results in a decrease of gonadotrophin and sex steroid levels.

The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

Angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in the growth and spread of several tumour types, with VEGF and PDGF overexpression linked to multiple cancers including cancers of the liver, lung, breast, kidney, bladder, ovaries, and colon. By inhibiting VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-kit pazopanib may stop or slow the rate of tumour growth and development. Pazopanib is currently being studied in a number of different tumour types; clinical trials are currently underway in renal cell carcinoma (Phase III), breast cancer (Phase III in inflammatory breast cancer), ovarian cancer, STS, NSCLC, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro. Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma.@@14922593@-@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@>> Takeda acquisition of Millennium completed.

14918869@Onco@@@@@300f1010ntsdm@@@@@@Intratumoural administration of Reolysin in combination with low-dose radiation in patients with advanced cancers.@@-@-@-@CALGARY, CANADA@@@Reolysin, a proprietary formulation of the human reovirus, has been demonstrated to replicate specifically in tumour cells bearing an activated Ras pathway. Activating mutations of Ras and upstream elements of Ras may play a role in greater than two thirds of all human cancers. Reolysin may represent a novel treatment for Ras activated tumour cells and some cellular proliferative disorders. Reovirus, an acronym for Respiratory Enteric Orphan virus, is generally believed to inhabit the respiratory and bowel systems in humans. Reovirus is found naturally in sewage and water supplies. By age 12, half of all children show evidence of reovirus exposure and by adulthood, most people have been exposed. However, the disease is non-pathogenic, meaning there are typically no symptoms from infections. The link to its cancer-killing ability was established after the reovirus was discovered to reproduce well in various cancer cell lines. Tumours bearing an activated Ras pathway are deficient in their ability to activate the anti-viral response mediated by the host cellular protein, PKR. Since PKR is responsible for preventing reovirus replication, tumour cells lacking the activity of PKR are susceptible to reovirus replication. As normal cells do not possess Ras activations, these cells are able to stop reovirus infection through normal PKR activity. In tumour cells with an activated Ras pathway, reovirus is able to freely replicate and eventually kill the host tumour cells. As cell death occurs, progeny virus particles are then free to infect surrounding cancer cells. This cycle of infection, replication and cell death is believed to be repeated until there are no longer any tumour cells carrying an activated Ras pathway available.@@14918869@Intratumoural administration of Reolysin in combination with low-dose radiation in patients with advanced cancers, including head and neck cancer.@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@@@-@@7/1/2006@-@N/A@@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@RESULTS PENDING@-@@@@-@-@@@@@-||||@ONCOLYTICS BIOTECH@@@@@ONCOLYTICS BIOTECH||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Head & Neck Cancer@Oesophageal Cancer@@@@Head & Neck Cancer|Oesophageal Cancer||||||||@REOLYSIN@@@@@REOLYSIN||||@Vaccine@@@@@Vaccine||||@RESPONSE RATE@IMMUNE RESPONSE@@@@@@@@@ADVANCED@REFRACTORY@@@@OPEN-LABEL@SINGLE-ARM@MULTI-CENTRE@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@INTRAVENOUS@GB£@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@243@United Kingdom

14918780@Onco@@@@@300f1018ntsdm@@@@@@-@@-@-@-@RICHMOND, AUSTRALIA@@@Cytopia has discovered a new class of orally bioavailable drugs that disrupt microtubule formation by interacting with tubulin. Compounds of this chemical series are highly potent anticancer agents which are not susceptible to multi-drug resistance. Importantly, they appear to act by a mechanism distinct from other drugs that work on this molecular target, and have shown vascular disrupting activity. Microtubules play an essential role in cell division and thus drugs that interfere with the normal function of microtubules disrupt the life cycle of cells, ultimately causing  cell death.  There are currently three main classes of tubulin-binding drugs; colchicine analogues; vinca-alkaloids; and taxanes. While certain taxanes and the vinca-alkaloids are widely used anticancer agents, the acquisition of multi-drug resistance (MDR+) by cancer cells is a significant impediment to their ongoing clinical use. CYT997 posesses in vivo efficacy in a several orthotopic models of solid tumor cancers and in a childhood t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia model, including a strong dose dependence demonstration of efficacy in a metastasising colon cancer model. Cytopia successfully concluded its first Phase I study for CYT997 in late 2007, administered intravenously.  Enrolment in a second Phase I study, where CYT997 is administered as a capsule dose, is ongoing.  The company has now received FDA approval and has commenced a Phase II study of CYT997 in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and will shortly commence another Phase II study in patients with glioma . @@14918780@-@@YES@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Arrowhead merged its two subsidiaries Calando and Insert Therapeutics in February 2008; now known as Calando Pharmaceuticals.@-@-@30@-@FDA orphan drug filing due in Q2 08.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer. Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs (PDGFR, RET, or KIT) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRß- and VEGFR2-dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo.@@14922362@Versus Gleevec@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Acquired through takeover of Pharmacia Corp., which acquired it from Sugen@-@NCT00372567@200@-@-@@@-@@7/1/2007@-@A6181112@@JANUARY 2011 (NCE EXCLUSIVITY); FEBRUARY 2021 (GIST PATENT)@-@@@IIIB@III@@-@-@RESULTS PENDING@-@@@@MONO@SUNITINIB MALEATE@@@@@SUNITINIB MALEATE||||@PFIZER@@@@@PFIZER||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Sarcoma@GIST@@@@Sarcoma|GIST||||||||@SUTENT@@@@@SUTENT||||@TK Inhibitor@VEGF@PDGF@SCF@@TK Inhibitor|VEGF|PDGF|SCF|@PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@PARALLEL ASSIGNMENT@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer. Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs (PDGFR, RET, or KIT) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRß- and VEGFR2-dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo.@@14922703@Combo with Gemzar@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Acquired through takeover of Pharmacia Corp., which acquired it from Sugen@FIRST-LINE@NCT00556049@36@-@-@@@-@@12/1/2007@-@07-212@@JANUARY 2011 (NCE EXCLUSIVITY); FEBRUARY 2021 (GIST PATENT)@-@@@II@II@@-@-@Endpoin over 2 cycles@-@@@@COMBO@SUNITINIB MALEATE@GEMCITABINE@@@@SUNITINIB MALEATE|GEMCITABINE|||@PFIZER@@@@@PFIZER||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Kidney Cancer@Renal Cell Carcinoma@@@@Kidney Cancer|Renal Cell Carcinoma||||||||@SUTENT@GEMZAR@@@@SUTENT|GEMZAR|||@TK Inhibitor@VEGF@PDGF@SCF@@TK Inhibitor|VEGF|PDGF|SCF|@RESPONSE RATE@@@@@@@@@@METASTATIC@@@@@NON-RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@SINGLE-ARM@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@US$@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

Studies demonstrated that its effects are mediated by a mechanism that is different from that of ciclosporin, tacrolimus, and other immunosuppressive agents. Experimental evidence suggests that sirolimus binds to the specific cytosolic protein FKPB-12 and that the FKPB 12-sirolimus complex inhibits the activation of the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR), a critical kinase for cell cycle progression. The inhibition of mTOR results in blockage of several specific signal transduction pathways. The net result is the inhibition of lymphocyte activation, which results in immunosuppression.@@14918753@Allogeneic/syngeneic blood stem cell transplant in patients with high-risk and recurrent paediatric sarcoma@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Pfizer acquired Wyeth on 26 January 2009 in a deal worth U.S $68 billion [Pfizer 26.01.2009]@-@NCT00047372@90@-@-@@@-@@9/1/2002@-@NCI-02-C-0259H@@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@RESULTS PENDING@-@@@@MONO@SIROLIMUS@@@@@SIROLIMUS||||@WYETH@PFIZER@@@@WYETH|PFIZER|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Sarcoma@@@@@Sarcoma|||||||||@RAPAMUNE@@@@@RAPAMUNE||||@Immunotherapy@Immunosuppressive@@@@Immunotherapy|Immunosuppressive|||@TOXICITY@@@@@@@@@@RELAPSED@@@@@PILOT@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@US$@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

NEUPOGEN containing rmetHuGCSF (filgrastim) causes marked increases in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within twenty-four hours, with minor increases in monocytes. In some severe chronic neutropenia patients filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and basophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia already prior to treatment. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dosedependent at recommended doses. Neutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. Following termination of filgrastim therapy, circulating neutrophil counts decrease by 50% within 1 to 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 to 7 days.@@15045773@Indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia.

The immune system then seeks out similar cells throughout the entire body in order to attack and destroy the unhealthy cells. Provecta, when it is within the cancerous cell's membrane, causes the lysosomes (a part of the cell that contains digestive enzymes which cause the destruction of the cell) to rupture or leak.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro.

Vidaza appears to exhibit its effects, inhibition of hypermethylation and direct toxicity, when cells are actively dividing.1 Because all cells are not in the same phase simultaneously, longer treatment time will expose more rapidly dividing cells to Vidaza.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14919816@• Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity: Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia • Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer or multiple myeloma • Paget's disease of bone.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@100%@@@@@Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in multiple myeloma - The recommended dose is 90 mg every 4 weeks.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14918217@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated With Highly Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy: The recommended adult oral dosage is 24 mg given as three 8-mg tablets administered 30 minutes before the start of single-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2.

Because tumor cells in general, and those in hypoxic zones in particular, are dependent on glycolysis for survival, tumor cells are particularly sensitive to the effect of 2DG. This compound is a synthetic glucose analog that distributes selectively to tumor tissue because of metabolic changes related to increased glucose consumption. Because tumor cells exhibit increased levels of glucose transport proteins, these cells actively transport 2DG into the cells. Once inside the cell, 2DG interferes with cellular mechanisms for generating energy by competing with glucose for key enzymes in glycolysis. The in vivo efficacy of 2DG has been studied in mouse and rat models of sarcomas, adenocarcinomas, leukemias, melanomas and bladder, colon and breast tumors. In particular, treatment with 2DG, alone and in combination with other chemotherapy, resulted in increased lifespan or a reduction in tumor growth in many of these models. @@14916182@Efficacy and safety of 2-Deoxyglucose (2DG) in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors.@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@@@-@@@-@TH-CR-101@@-@Histologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancy Previously treated with at least one chemotherapy regimen for advanced or metastatic disease OR no curative standard treatment is available Recovered from reversible toxicities of prior therapy@@@I@I@@-@-@-@-@@@@COMBO@2-DEOXYGLUCOSE@DOCETAXEL@@@@2-DEOXYGLUCOSE|DOCETAXEL|||@THRESHOLD PHARMACEUTICALS@@@@@THRESHOLD PHARMACEUTICALS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Solid Tumours@@@@@Solid Tumours|||||||||@2DG@TAXOTERE@@@@2DG|TAXOTERE|||@Other@@@@@Other||||@-@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@RANDOMISED@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@US$@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14920137@Management of breakthrough cancer pain in patients with malignancies who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Teva announces acquisition of Barr.

In some severe chronic neutropenia patients filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and basophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia already prior to treatment. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dosedependent at recommended doses. Neutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. Following termination of filgrastim therapy, circulating neutrophil counts decrease by 50% within 1 to 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 to 7 days.@@15045777@Indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia.

Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38.

The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation.

This is necessary to minimise the possibility of infarction and haemorrhage in the tumour due to a rapid cytotoxic effect of mitotane. Shock, severe trauma or infection: Mitotane should be temporarily discontinued immediately following shock, severe trauma or infection, since adrenal suppression is its prime action. Exogenous steroids should be administered in such circumstances, since the depressed adrenal gland may not immediately start to secrete steroids. Because of an increased risk of acute adrenocortical insufficiency, patients should be instructed to contact their physician immediately if injury, infection, or other illness occurs. Patients should carry with them the card provided with the package leaflet indicating that they are prone to adrenal insufficiency and that in case of emergency care, adequate precautionary measures should be taken. Monitoring of plasma levels: Mitotane plasma levels should be monitored in order to adjust the Lysodren dose. It may be especially recommended in cases where administration of higher starting doses is considered necessary (e.g. in highly symptomatic patients) to reach the desired therapeutic levels more rapidly. The therapeutic window of mitotane lies between 14 mg/l and 20 mg/l. A dose adjustment may be necessary to achieve the correct therapeutic level and avoid specific adverse reactions.

In postmenopausal women, oestrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens - primarily androstenedione and testosterone - to oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2). The suppression of oestrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Letrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the haem of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of oestrogen biosynthesis in all tissues.@@14916087@Clinical Trial Correlating the Effects of 24 Months of Exemestane or Letrozole on Surrogate Markers of Response With Aromatase Polymorphism@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00263913@160@-@-@@@-@@11/1/2005@-@UMCC 2005.074@@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@Trial registered.

The product was discovered in 1996 by Pr André Trouet and his team at the Université Catholique de Louvain, Belgium and in-licensed from Medarex Inc in April 2003 for exclusive EU rights. DTS-201 is also known as Super-Leu-Dox or CPI-0004Na in the USA. DTS-201 completed Phase I clinical studies in Belgium and France in October 2007. DTS-201 is a prodrug designed to preferentially deliver doxorubicin to tumors as opposed to normal tissues. It consists of the tetrapeptide N-succinyl-ß-alanyl-L-leucyl-L-alanyl-L-leucine covalently linked to the aminoglycoside portion of doxorubicin. The DTS-201 concept is based on the inactivation of doxorubicin by the coupling of a tetrapeptidic sequence that prevents cellular uptake. DTS-201 is stable in blood but cleavable by some specific peptidases present in the tumor environment.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer. Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs (PDGFR, RET, or KIT) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRß- and VEGFR2-dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo.@@14922360@With cisplatin and S-1@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Acquired through takeover of Pharmacia Corp., which acquired it from Sugen@-@NCT00553696@30@-@-@@@-@@11/1/2007@-@A6181127@@JANUARY 2011 (NCE EXCLUSIVITY); FEBRUARY 2021 (GIST PATENT)@-@@@I@I@@-@-@RESULTS PENDING@-@@@@COMBO@SUNITINIB MALEATE@CISPLATIN@@@@SUNITINIB MALEATE|CISPLATIN|||@PFIZER@@@@@PFIZER||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Stomach Cancer@@@@@Stomach Cancer|||||||||@SUTENT@@@@@SUTENT||||@TK Inhibitor@VEGF@PDGF@SCF@@TK Inhibitor|VEGF|PDGF|SCF|@DOSE-LIMITING TOXICITY@@@@@@@@@@ADVANCED@METASTATIC@@@@NON-RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@SINGLE-ARM@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@US$@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

TG 1042 consists of a non-propagative adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) with a nucleotidic sequence encoding the human gamma interferon cytokine (IFN?). The antitumor activity of IFN? is the result of anti-proliferative, immunomodulating and anti-angiogenic ativities of this cytokine. TG 1042 is based on the human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) of subgroup C. This adenoviral strain only causes benign respiratory tract infections in humans. During the life cycle of the wild-type virus, viral genomic DNA does not integrate into the host chromosomes. Indeed, replication of virions, which occurs in the nucleus of infected cells, involves episomal genetic elements. Adenovirus-based vectors are therefore safe and do not present any risk of insertional mutagenesis. In addition, TG 1042 was rendered replication-deficient by removal of early region 1 (E1), a segment of the viral genome which is indispensable for viral propagation. The human IFN? cDNA was inserted into the E1 region. TG 1042 is also deleted of the non-essential E3 region. TG 1042's antitumoral activity relies on the secretion of human IFN? from tumor cells adenovirally-transduced with the nucleotidic sequence encoding the cytokine. IFN? is a natural immunostimulant produced in the body, whose antitumoral properties were demonstrated both in animals and in humans.@@14924779@Relapsing primary cutaneous b-cell lymphoma@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00394693@13@-@TARGETING REGULATORY APPROVAL IN 2009@@@-@@11/1/2006@-@-@@-@13 PATIENTS IN 1ST STAGE, ANOTHER 28 PATIENTS IN SECOND CONFIRMATORY STAGE@@@II@II@@-@-@RESULTS PENDING@-@@@@MONO@-@@@@@-||||@TRANSGENE@@@@@TRANSGENE||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@B-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|B-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@TG-1042@@@@@TG-1042||||@Gene Therapy@@@@@Gene Therapy||||@RESPONSE RATE@SAFETY@QUALITY OF LIFE@@@QUALITY OF LIFE@@@@@RELAPSED@@@@@NON-RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@UNCONTROLLED@SINGLE-ARM@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@US$@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

In postmenopausal women, oestrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens - primarily androstenedione and testosterone - to oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2). The suppression of oestrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Letrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the haem of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of oestrogen biosynthesis in all tissues.@@14916003@Zoledronic Acid in the Prevention of Cancer Treatment-Related Bone Loss in Postmenopausal Women With Estrogen Receptor Positive and/or Progesterone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer Receiving Letrozole as Adjuvant Therapy@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00050011@602@-@-@@@-@@7/1/2002@-@ZFAST@@-@-@@@III@III@@-@-@Trial registered.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14919817@• Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity: Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia • Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer or multiple myeloma • Paget's disease of bone.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@100%@@@@@Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia; please see label for dosing ranges; the total dose of pamidronate disodium may be administered either in a single infusion or in multiple infusions over 2-4 consecutive days.

By reducing production of Bcl-2 in cancer cells, it seeks to restore the basic biological process whereby cancer cells can be readily killed by treatment with current methods of anticancer therapy. Genta's clinical trials programs focus on treating cancer patients with Genasense along with the administration of anticancer therapy with the intention of potentiating the cancer-killing effects of treatment. Genta is developing Genasense Injection with the intention of potentiating the cancer-killing activity of standard anticancer therapies. In a typical example, Genasense might be administered for several days and then be immediately followed by regular doses of chemotherapy. This sequence would then be repeated, depending upon the particular type of chemotherapy regimen and indication. In other applications, Genasense might be administered concurrent with or after conventional chemotherapy, again depending on the chemotherapy and indication. Genasense has the potential to be used in combination with most types of anticancer therapy.@@14921301@-@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00016263@750@-@-@@@-@@7/1/2000@-@GENTA-GM301@@-@-@@@III@III@@-@-@RESULTS PENDING@-@@@@COMBO@OBLIMERSEN SODIUM@@@@@OBLIMERSEN SODIUM||||@GENTA@@@@@GENTA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Melanoma / Skin Cancer@@@@@Melanoma / Skin Cancer|||||||||@GENASENSE@@@@@GENASENSE||||@Bcl-2 Inhibitor@@@@@Bcl-2 Inhibitor||||@OVERALL SURVIVAL@PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL@RESPONSE RATE@@@RESPONSE RATE@@@@@ADVANCED@@@@@RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@ACTIVE CONTROL@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@INJECTION@US$@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38.

NEUPOGEN containing rmetHuGCSF (filgrastim) causes marked increases in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within twenty-four hours, with minor increases in monocytes. In some severe chronic neutropenia patients filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and basophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia already prior to treatment. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dosedependent at recommended doses. Neutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. Following termination of filgrastim therapy, circulating neutrophil counts decrease by 50% within 1 to 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 to 7 days.@@15045787@Indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia. The safety and efficacy of filgrastim are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. It is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC).

The effects of perifosine on Akt are of particular interest because of the importance of this pathway in the development of most cancers, the evidence that it is often activated in tumors that are resistant to other forms of anticancer therapy, and the difficulty encountered thus far in the discovery of drugs that will inhibit this pathway without causing excessive toxicity. High levels of activated Akt (pAkt) are seen frequently in many types of cancer and have been correlated with poor prognosis in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma, gastric, hepatocellular, endometrial, prostate, renal cell, head and neck cancers and hematological malignancies, as well as glioblastoma. The majority of tumors expressing high levels of pAkt were high-grade, advanced stage or had other features associated with poor prognosis. High pAkt is often seen in tumors that are resistant to conventional cancer treatments, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and especially therapy with some of the newer biologicals. Published data suggest that the Akt pathway is frequently activated in renal cell cancer and that this tumor type may be particularly responsive to Akt inhibition.@@14916631@-@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Keryx receives notice from Nasdaq that the company is not in compliance with the US$1 minimum bid price for continued listing and most reach this within 180 days.

It is a peptide and therefore unrelated to the steroids. Chronic administration results in an inhibition of gonadotrophin production and subsequent suppression of ovarian and testicular steroid secretion. This effect is reversible on discontinuation of therapy. Administration of leuprorelin acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of gonadotrophins which leads to a transient increase in gonadal steroid levels in both men and women. Continued administration of leuprorelin acetate results in a decrease of gonadotrophin and sex steroid levels. In men serum testosterone levels, initially raised in response to early luteinising hormone (LH) release, fall to castrate levels in about 2-4 weeks.

In postmenopausal women, oestrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens - primarily androstenedione and testosterone - to oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2). The suppression of oestrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Letrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the haem of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of oestrogen biosynthesis in all tissues.@@14922667@Combination of Letrozole 2.5 Mg Daily and Trastuzumab 2 Mg/Kg Weekly in ErbB2 Positive and Estrogen Receptor and/or Progesterone Receptor Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Roche announces US$43.7 billion proposal to assume full control of Genentech.

The binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some but not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance gene.

Calcium folinate is frequently used to diminish the toxicity and counteract the action of folate antagonists, such as methotrexate. Calcium folinate and folate antagonists share the same membrane transport carrier and compete for transport into cells, stimulating folate antagonist efflux. It also protects cells from the effects of folate antagonist by repletion of the reduce folate pool.

Ixabepilone is a semi-synthetic analog of epothilone B. Ixabepilone binds directly to ß-tubulin subunits on microtubules, leading to suppression of microtubule dynamics. Ixabepilone suppresses the dynamic instability of  ß-II and  ß-III microtubules.

14923006@Onco@@@@@@@@@@@-@@-@-@-@SEATTLE, WASHINGTON@@@Opaxio (paclitaxel poliglumex, CT-2103), which was previously branded as Xyotax, is an investigational, biologically enhanced, chemotherapeutic that links paclitaxel, the active ingredient in Taxol(R), to a biodegradable polyglutamate polymer, which results in a new chemical entity. When bound to the polymer, paclitaxel is rendered inactive, potentially sparing normal tissue's exposure to high levels of the active drug and its associated toxicities. Blood vessels in tumor tissue, unlike blood vessels in normal tissue, are porous to molecules like polyglutamate. Based on preclinical studies, it appears that Opaxio is preferentially distributed to tumors due to their leaky blood vessels and trapped in the tumor bed allowing significantly more of the dose of chemotherapy to localize in the tumor than with standard paclitaxel. Once inside the tumor cell, enzymes metabolize the protein polymer, releasing the paclitaxel chemotherapy. Preclinical and clinical studies support that Opaxio metabolism by lung cancer cells may be influenced by estrogen, which could lead to enhanced release of paclitaxel and efficacy in women with lung cancer compared to standard therapies. This is being studied in an ongoing phase III trial.@@14923006@First-line NSCLC who have ECOG performance 2@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@-@-@October 2006; Novartis licensed exclusive worldwide development and commercialisation rjghts of Xyotax for up to US$270 million.

Bevacizumab contains human framework regions and the complementarity-determining regions of a murine antibody that binds to VEGF (1). Bevacizumab is produced in a Chinese Hamster Ovary mammalian cell expression system in a nutrient medium containing the antibiotic gentamicin and has a molecular weight of approximately 149 kilodaltons. Bevacizumab binds VEGF and prevents the interaction of VEGF to its receptors (Flt-1 and KDR) on the surface of endothelial cells. The interaction of VEGF with its receptors leads to endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation in in vitro models ofangiogenesis.

It is a peptide and therefore unrelated to the steroids. Chronic administration results in an inhibition of gonadotrophin production and subsequent suppression of ovarian and testicular steroid secretion. This effect is reversible on discontinuation of therapy. Administration of leuprorelin acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of gonadotrophins which leads to a transient increase in gonadal steroid levels in both men and women. Continued administration of leuprorelin acetate results in a decrease of gonadotrophin and sex steroid levels. In men serum testosterone levels, initially raised in response to early luteinising hormone (LH) release, fall to castrate levels in about 2-4 weeks.

Compared to leucovorin, CoFactor creates more stable binding between the active form of 5-FU and the target enzyme, thymidylate synthase, or TS. CoFactor bypasses the metabolic pathway required by leucovorin to deliver the active form of folate, potentially allowing 5-FU to work more effectively. Inhibiting TS is a well-established and effective method of killing rapidly dividing cells, such as tumor cells. Inhibition of TS is most frequently accomplished through use of 5-FU, the metabolite of which binds to TS and disrupts cell replication.

Genta is developing Genasense Injection with the intention of potentiating the cancer-killing activity of standard anticancer therapies. In a typical example, Genasense might be administered for several days and then be immediately followed by regular doses of chemotherapy. This sequence would then be repeated, depending upon the particular type of chemotherapy regimen and indication.

The total daily dose may be divided in two or three doses according to patient's convenience, and the treatment should be preferably taken during meals.@@@@@@@Before the initiation of the treatment: All possible tumour tissues should be surgically removed from large metastatic masses before mitotane administration is instituted. This is necessary to minimise the possibility of infarction and haemorrhage in the tumour due to a rapid cytotoxic effect of mitotane. Shock, severe trauma or infection: Mitotane should be temporarily discontinued immediately following shock, severe trauma or infection, since adrenal suppression is its prime action. Exogenous steroids should be administered in such circumstances, since the depressed adrenal gland may not immediately start to secrete steroids. Because of an increased risk of acute adrenocortical insufficiency, patients should be instructed to contact their physician immediately if injury, infection, or other illness occurs. Patients should carry with them the card provided with the package leaflet indicating that they are prone to adrenal insufficiency and that in case of emergency care, adequate precautionary measures should be taken. Monitoring of plasma levels: Mitotane plasma levels should be monitored in order to adjust the Lysodren dose. It may be especially recommended in cases where administration of higher starting doses is considered necessary (e.g. in highly symptomatic patients) to reach the desired therapeutic levels more rapidly. The therapeutic window of mitotane lies between 14 mg/l and 20 mg/l. A dose adjustment may be necessary to achieve the correct therapeutic level and avoid specific adverse reactions.

In postmenopausal women, oestrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens - primarily androstenedione and testosterone - to oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2). The suppression of oestrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Letrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the haem of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of oestrogen biosynthesis in all tissues.@@14919304@Lifestyle Intervention Study in Adjuvant Treatment of Early Breast Cancer@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00463489@2150@-@-@@@-@@8/1/2007@-@LISA@@-@-@@@III@III@@-@-@Trial registered.

In preclinical studies, STA-9090 has shown the ability to inhibit multiple kinases with comparable potency to, and a broader activity profile than specific kinase inhibitors such as imatinib (Gleevec), erlotinib (Tarceva), and sunitinib (Sutent). In addition, STA-9090 has shown potency 10 to100 times greater than the ansamycin family of Hsp90 inhibitors, as well as activity against a wider range of kinases. In in vivo models, STA-9090 has shown strong activity in a wide range of cancer types, including cancers resistant to Gleevec, Tarceva, and Sutent.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer. Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs (PDGFR, RET, or KIT) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRß- and VEGFR2-dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo.@@14922381@Advanced or metastatic gastric cancer progressed or recurrent after chemo@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Acquired through takeover of Pharmacia Corp., which acquired it from Sugen@SECOND-LINE@NCT00226811@160@-@-@@@-@@1/1/2006@-@A6181054@@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@Endpoint over 1 year.@-@@@@MONO@SUNITINIB MALEATE@@@@@SUNITINIB MALEATE||||@PFIZER@@@@@PFIZER||||@China@@@@@China|||||||||@Stomach Cancer@@@@@Stomach Cancer|||||||||@SUTENT@@@@@SUTENT||||@TK Inhibitor@VEGF@PDGF@SCF@@TK Inhibitor|VEGF|PDGF|SCF|@RESPONSE RATE@@@@@@@@@@REFRACTORY@METASTATIC@@@@NON-RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@SINGLE-ARM@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@-@-@@@@@@@@@-@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
