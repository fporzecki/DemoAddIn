It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922267@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@382@Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in multiple myeloma - The recommended dose is 90 mg every 4 weeks.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918415@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Novartis purchases Hexal and Eon Labs in a 5.65 billion euro deal. [Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@139.3@187.1@144.39@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@6.97@6.97@5988909@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@37.5@MCG@37.5 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

Frequent patient review is required to appropriately titrate the dose against disease activity.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919710@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that exposure of CLL lymphocytes to 2F-ara-A triggers extensive DNA fragmentation and cell death characteristic of apoptosis.@@14917905@Treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in patients with sufficient bone marrow reserves.

The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro.

Appropriate management of the therapy and its complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. Patients should be informed not only of the benefits of therapy but also that they will probably experience adverse reactions. Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately. Psychiatric intervention and/or drug discontinuation should be considered in such cases. Ophthalmologic: As with other interferons, retinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis and optic neuropathy which may result in loss of vision, have been reported after treatment with Roferon-A. Any patient complaining of decrease or loss of vision must have an eye examination. Because these ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual examination prior to initiation of Roferon-A monotherapy or in the combination therapy with ribavirin is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.

A lower initial dosage (12 mg/m2 or less) is recommended for patients with inadequate bone marrow reserves e.g. due to prior chemotherapy or poor general condition.

Mitoxantrone has also been used in various combinations for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, however data are presently limited and specific regimens cannot be recommended. As a guide, when mitoxantrone is used in combination chemotherapy with another myelosuppressive agent, the initial dose of mitoxantrone should be reduced by 2-4 mg/m2 below the doses recommended for single agent use.

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that exposure of CLL lymphocytes to 2F-ara-A triggers extensive DNA fragmentation and cell death characteristic of apoptosis.@@14919063@Treatment of adult patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have not responded to or whose disease has progressed during treatment with at least one standard alkylating-agent containing regimen.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@No tiering.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@WINTHROP@SANOFI-AVENTIS@@@@WINTHROP|SANOFI-AVENTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@23.86@41.15@25.31@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@4.77@4.77@3978338@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MCG@25 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14916932@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: Aredia, in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with Aredia.

Paget's Disease Aredia is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of Aredia was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase =3 times the upper limit of normal.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14922046@Indicated for the management of nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and for the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV).@@NO@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@100%@-@-@-@-@Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated With Highly Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy: The recommended adult oral dosage is 24 mg given as three 8-mg tablets administered 30 minutes before the start of single-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2.

However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

Alternatively, 0.5 to 1 mg/kg may be infused daily in 1-24 hours for ten days, and then at a rate of 2 mg/kg/day until toxicity is observed. Continue to toxicity or until remission occurs. Results from one hour infusions have been satisfactory in the majority of patients. Intermittent dosing: Cytarabine may be given as intermittent intravenous doses of 3-5 mg/kg daily, for five consecutive days. This course of treatment can be repeated after an interval of 2 to 9 days, and repeated until the therapeutic response or toxicity is exhibited. Evidence of bone marrow improvement has been reported to occur 7-64 days days after the beginning of therapy. In general, if a patient shows neither remission or toxicity after a trial period, then cautiously administered higher doses can be administered. Generally patients tolerate higher doses given by rapid intravenous injection rather than slow infusion. As a single agent for induction of remissions in patients with acute leukaemia, cytarabine has been given in doses of 200 mg/m2 by continuous intravenous infusion for five days at approximately 2 week intervals. Maintainance therapy: To maintain remission, doses of 1-1.5 mg/kg may be given intravenously or subcutaneously, once or twice weekly. Myelosuppression, anaemia and thrombocytopenia occur almost to all patients given daily infusions or injections. Myelosuppression is biphasic and nadirs at 7-9 and 15-24 days. Evidence of bone marrow improvement may be expected 7-64 (mean 28) days after the beginning of treatment.@EMA, September 1997@@@@@@Only physicians experienced in cancer chemotherapy should use Cytarabine for Injection USP. For induction therapy, patients should be treated in a facility with laboratory and supportive resources sufficient to monitor drug tolerance and protect and maintain a patient compromised by drug toxicity. The main toxic effect of cytarabine is bone marrow suppression with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Less serious toxicity includes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, oral ulceration, and hepatic dysfunction.

Doses in excess of 100 mg are usually given parenterally, when the injectable preparation should be used. Doses in excess of 70 mg/m2 should not be administered without leucovorin rescue (folinic acid rescue) or assay of serum methotrexate levels 24 - 48 hours after dosing.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms.

The data were derived from the pivotal 320 patient, Phase III trial for Ceplene, which met its primary endpoint of increased LFS (p less than 0.01) among AML patients in their first remission. By performing a weighted linear regression analysis between estimates of LFS and OS at specific time points and between the estimated effects of Ceplene with IL-2 on LFS and OS, researchers found a high correlation between the country-specific Kaplan-Meier estimates of 24-month LFS and 36-month OS in both treated and untreated groups (R(2) = 0.71; P=0.0002). Similar correlations were also found between 24-month LFS and 48-month and 60-month OS. In addition, country-specific hazard ratios demonstrated that the treatment effect of Ceplene with IL-2 on LFS and OS were found to be highly correlated (R(2) = 0.84; P=0.004).

In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT.

Patients with large cell carcinoma who were treated with the pemetrexed regimen achieved 10.4 months of overall median survival versus 6.7 months for those treated with the gemcitabine regimen.

Comparatively, patients with squamous cell histology were found to have a more favorable rate of survival when treated with the gemcitabine regimen, achieving 10.8 months of median survival, compared to the 9.4 months for those treated with the pemetrexed regimen.

Activating mutations of Ras and upstream elements of Ras may play a role in greater than two thirds of all human cancers. Reolysin may represent a novel treatment for Ras activated tumour cells and some cellular proliferative disorders. Reovirus, an acronym for Respiratory Enteric Orphan virus, is generally believed to inhabit the respiratory and bowel systems in humans. Reovirus is found naturally in sewage and water supplies. By age 12, half of all children show evidence of reovirus exposure and by adulthood, most people have been exposed. However, the disease is non-pathogenic, meaning there are typically no symptoms from infections. The link to its cancer-killing ability was established after the reovirus was discovered to reproduce well in various cancer cell lines. Tumours bearing an activated Ras pathway are deficient in their ability to activate the anti-viral response mediated by the host cellular protein, PKR. Since PKR is responsible for preventing reovirus replication, tumour cells lacking the activity of PKR are susceptible to reovirus replication. As normal cells do not possess Ras activations, these cells are able to stop reovirus infection through normal PKR activity. In tumour cells with an activated Ras pathway, reovirus is able to freely replicate and eventually kill the host tumour cells. As cell death occurs, progeny virus particles are then free to infect surrounding cancer cells. This cycle of infection, replication and cell death is believed to be repeated until there are no longer any tumour cells carrying an activated Ras pathway available.@@14919010@-@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@-@23@-@-@@@-@@12/1/2007@-@N/A@@-@-@@@I@I@@-@-@>> Enrollment completed.

Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919648@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@357@Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated With Highly Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy: The recommended adult oral dosage is 24 mg given as three 8-mg tablets administered 30 minutes before the start of single-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919708@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918448@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@RATIOPHARM@@@@@RATIOPHARM||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@337.83@438.11@349.17@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@16.89@16.89@1039487@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14920875@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation.

Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate.

Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@WYETH@PFIZER@@@@WYETH|PFIZER|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia||||||||@METHOTREXAT LEDERLE@@@@@METHOTREXAT LEDERLE||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1.1511@15.25@30.26@16.43@@@@@@@@@@0.31@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@15.25@15.25@3362583@SOLUTION FOR INJECTION (2 ML)@EURO@@@@@@@@50@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922061@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases.

Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer. Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs (PDGFR, RET, or KIT) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRß- and VEGFR2-dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo.@@14923361@Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor GIST: indicated for the treatment of GIST after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919895@1.

Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration.

Maintenance dosage: Three million IU, given three times per week by subcutaneous injection. If intolerance develops, the dose should be lowered to 1.5 million IU three times per week.@N/A@@@-@@@Roferon-A should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the management of the respective indication. Appropriate management of the therapy and its complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. Patients should be informed not only of the benefits of therapy but also that they will probably experience adverse reactions. Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately. Psychiatric intervention and/or drug discontinuation should be considered in such cases. Ophthalmologic: As with other interferons, retinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis and optic neuropathy which may result in loss of vision, have been reported after treatment with Roferon-A. Any patient complaining of decrease or loss of vision must have an eye examination. Because these ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual examination prior to initiation of Roferon-A monotherapy or in the combination therapy with ribavirin is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917797@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922293@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases.

Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone.

The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Herceptin has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Herceptin is a mediator of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, Herceptin-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2@@14920491@Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC): Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2: a) as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.

Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A.

Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately. Psychiatric intervention and/or drug discontinuation should be considered in such cases. Ophthalmologic: As with other interferons, retinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis and optic neuropathy which may result in loss of vision, have been reported after treatment with Roferon-A.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@NYCOMED@@@@@NYCOMED||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@MATRIFEN@@@@@MATRIFEN||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@9@1.1511@116.44@158.2@120.81@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@12.94@12.94@7331125@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@75@MCG@75 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

It also possesses marked immunosuppressant properties. The principal site of cyclophosphamide activation is the liver. The chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant activity of cyclophosphamide is thought to be mediated by the cytotoxic intermediates produced by activation by mixed function oxidases in hepatic microsomes. Non-enzymatic cleavage, possibly taking place in the tumour cells, results in the formulation of highly cytotoxic forms of the drug.@@14916980@Although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to Cytoxan treatment: 1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma. 2. Multiple myeloma. 3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (Cytoxan given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration). 4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). 5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). 6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 7. Retinoblastoma. 8. Carcinoma of the breast. Cytoxan is also used in non-malignant disease: it is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid therapy or in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, Cytoxan may induce a remission. Cytoxan is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Oral Cytoxan dosing is usually in the range of 1 to 5 mg/kg/day for both initial and maintenance dosing. Many other regimens of intravenous and oral Cytoxan have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia. When Cytoxan is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose as well as that of the other drugs. Cytoxan and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of Cytoxan metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.@FDA, 29 April 1987@4/29/1987@@@@@Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoproliferative malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically. Urinary System: Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal. Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Cardiac Toxicity: Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium. No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Infections: Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@2000@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE||||@BMS@@@@@BMS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@Breast Cancer@Ovarian Cancer@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia|Breast Cancer|Ovarian Cancer||||||@CYTOXAN@@@@@CYTOXAN||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@100@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@00015-0504-01@TABLET@US$@@@@@@@@25@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14921162@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@NYCOMED@@@@@NYCOMED||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@MATRIFEN@@@@@MATRIFEN||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@19@1.1511@247.39@323.76@255.88@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@13.02@13.02@7331131@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@75@MCG@75 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

[clinicaltrials.gov]@@L01XC02@L01X@-@BASEL, SWITZERLAND@10/1/2011@@Rituximab binds specifically to the antigen CD20 (human B-lymphocyte-restricted differentiation antigen, Bp35), a hydrophobic transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of approximately 35 kD located on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14918191@Methotrexate is used in the treatment of adults with severe, active, classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis who are unresponsive or intolerant to conventional therapy. Methotrexate has also been used in the treatment of severe, uncontrolled psoriasis, which is not responsive to other therapy. Methotrexate has been used to produce regression in a wide range of neoplastic conditions including acute leukaemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue and osteogenic sarcomas, and solid tumours particularly breast, lung, head and neck, bladder, cervical, ovarian, and testicular carcinoma.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Acquired via takeover of generics unit of Merck KGaA@@@@Dosage for cancer treatment: A test dose of 5 - 10 mg parenterally is recommended, one week prior to therapy to detect idiosyncratic adverse events.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@NO NICE REVIEW@NHS@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@JOHNSON & JOHNSON@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@JOHNSON & JOHNSON|JANSSEN CILAG|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@DUROGESIC@@@@@DUROGESIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.2961@57.86@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/21/2017@11.57@11.57@9.09E+15@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@GB£@@@@@@@@100@MCG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@243@United Kingdom

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@RATIOPHARM@@@@@RATIOPHARM||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@48@71.67@50.21@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@4.8@4.8@1039381@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MCG@25 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

The calculated daily dose(s) of the drug is then diluted with 5% dextrose or 0.9% sodium chloride injection to a volume appropriate for the infusion apparatus to be used. The administration of FUDR is best achieved with the use of an appropriate pump to overcome pressure in large arteries and to ensure a uniform rate of infusion. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. The recommended therapeutic dosage schedule of FUDR by continuous arterial infusion is 0.1 to 0.6 mg/kg/day. The higher dosage ranges (0.4 mg to 0.6 mg) are usually employed for hepatic artery infusion because the liver metabolizes the drug, thus reducing the potential for systemic toxicity. Therapy can be given until adverse reactions appear. When these side effects have subsided, therapy may be resumed. The patient should be maintained on therapy as long as response to FUDR continues. Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been published. 1 - 6 There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.@@@@@@@Because of the possibility of severe toxic reactions, all patients should be hospitalized for initiation of the first course of therapy. FUDR should be used with extreme caution in poor risk patients with impaired hepatic or renal function or a history of high-dose pelvic irradiation or previous use of alkylating agents.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917823@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia.

14917320@Onco@@@@@300f1014ntsdm@300f1813ntsdm@@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@NO@NEW YORK, NEW YORK@@@Cyclophosphamide is an antineoplastic agent which is converted in the body to an active alkylating metabolite. It also possesses marked immunosuppressant properties. The principal site of cyclophosphamide activation is the liver. The chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant activity of cyclophosphamide is thought to be mediated by the cytotoxic intermediates produced by activation by mixed function oxidases in hepatic microsomes. Non-enzymatic cleavage, possibly taking place in the tumour cells, results in the formulation of highly cytotoxic forms of the drug.@@14917320@Although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to Cytoxan treatment: 1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma. 2. Multiple myeloma. 3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (Cytoxan given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration). 4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). 5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). 6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 7. Retinoblastoma. 8. Carcinoma of the breast. Cytoxan is also used in non-malignant disease: it is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid therapy or in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, Cytoxan may induce a remission. Cytoxan is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.@@@@@@@@-@@@@@@When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of Cytoxan for patients with no hematologic deficiency usually consists of 40 to 50 mg/kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens include 10 to 15 mg/kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 to 5 mg/kg twice weekly. Many other regimens of intravenous and oral Cytoxan have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia. When Cytoxan is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose as well as that of the other drugs. Cytoxan and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of Cytoxan metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.@1-Nov-59@11/1/1959@@@@@Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoproliferative malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically. Urinary System: Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal. Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Cardiac Toxicity: Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium. No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Infections: Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@RAMQ@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE||||@BMS@@@@@BMS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia@Acute Myeloid Leukaemia@Hodgkin's Lymphoma@Myeloma@Haematological Malignancy|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia|Acute Myeloid Leukaemia|Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Myeloma|||||@CYTOXAN@@@@@CYTOXAN||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@100@0.7934@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@INJECTION@C$@@@@@@@@50@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@49@Canada

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14918184@Methotrexate is used in the treatment of adults with severe, active, classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis who are unresponsive or intolerant to conventional therapy. Methotrexate has also been used in the treatment of severe, uncontrolled psoriasis, which is not responsive to other therapy. Methotrexate has been used to produce regression in a wide range of neoplastic conditions including acute leukaemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue and osteogenic sarcomas, and solid tumours particularly breast, lung, head and neck, bladder, cervical, ovarian, and testicular carcinoma.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Dosage for cancer treatment: A test dose of 5 - 10 mg parenterally is recommended, one week prior to therapy to detect idiosyncratic adverse events. Single doses, not exceeding 30 mg/m2, on not more than 5 consecutive days. A rest period of at least two weeks is recommended between treatments, in order to allow the bone marrow to return to normal. Doses in excess of 100 mg are usually given parenterally, when the injectable preparation should be used. Doses in excess of 70 mg/m2 should not be administered without leucovorin rescue (folinic acid rescue) or assay of serum methotrexate levels 24 - 48 hours after dosing.

Hepatic toxicity has been observed, usually associated with chronic hepatic disease. Renal lesions may develop if the urinary flow is impeded and urinary pH is low, especially if large doses have been administered.

Such toxicity may necessitate temporary suspension or cessation of therapy. Hepatic toxicity, accompanied by hepatic vein thrombosis and hepatocellular necrosis resulting in death, have been reported. The incidence of such reactions has been low. This toxicity has been observed mostly when dacarbazine has been administered concomitantly with other anti-neoplastic drugs; however, it has also been reported in some patients treated with dacarbazine alone.

Tumor destruction and safety was shown in patients with diverse cancer types in three Phase I trials; treated patients were end-stage and had no effective therapies available. JX-594 multiplies selectively within cancer cells, leading to their destruction. These newly created copies of JX-594 are then released and are able to infect and eradicate other tumor cells both locally and in distant sites in the body. This cycle of JX-594 replication, cancer cell destruction, release and spread is then repeated. Normal cells are not affected by JX-594 resulting in safety and tolerability. The poxvirus strain backbone of JX-594 has been used safely in millions of people as part of a worldwide vaccination program against smallpox. This strain naturally targets cancer cells due to common genetic defects in cancer cells. JX-594 was engineered to enhance this natural safety and cancer-selectivity by deleting its thymidine kinase (TK) gene, thus making it dependent on the cellular TK expressed at persistently high levels in cancer cells. To enhance product efficacy, JX-594 is also engineered to express the GM-CSF protein. GM-CSF complements the cancer cell lysis work of the product candidate, leading to a cascade of events resulting in tumor necrosis, tumor vasculature shutdown and an anti-tumoral immune attack. @@14920930@Unresectable primary HCC@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Jennerex Biotherapeutics announced an agreement with Green Cross Corp., South Korea for the development and commercialization in Korea of JX-594 , an oncolytic vaccinia virus for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) as the initial indication.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

High doses of MTX can cause kidney damage in some cancer patients and this can delay the elimination of MTX from the body. Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of MTX commonly results in serious toxic effects such as mucositis (painful mouth sores), reduced platelet and white blood counts (myelosuppression) , kidney failure and an increased risk of sepsis and in some instances death. A number of cancer patients die every year from MTX induced toxicity, typically due to sepsis.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@RATIOPHARM@@@@@RATIOPHARM||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@129.49@174.7@134.27@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@12.95@12.95@1039441@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@75@MCG@75 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

Median OS was not reached in either pembrolizumab arm.  As compared to the ipilimumab arm, a significant improvement in PFS was observed in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W and Q3W arms with HR of 0.58 [95% CI 0.46, 0.72]; p<0.001 and 0.58 [95% CI: 0.47, 0.72]; p<0.001, respectively.  Median PFS was 5.5 and 4.1 months in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W and Q3W arms, respectively, and was 2.8 months in the ipilimumab arm.  The overall response rates were 34 %, 33 %, and 12% for patients in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, and ipilimumab arms, respectively.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14916910@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@YES@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@@-@-@-@382@Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in multiple myeloma - The recommended dose is 90 mg every 4 weeks.

It also possesses marked immunosuppressant properties. The principal site of cyclophosphamide activation is the liver. The chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant activity of cyclophosphamide is thought to be mediated by the cytotoxic intermediates produced by activation by mixed function oxidases in hepatic microsomes. Non-enzymatic cleavage, possibly taking place in the tumour cells, results in the formulation of highly cytotoxic forms of the drug.@@14917316@Although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs.

Multiple myeloma. 3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (Cytoxan given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration). 4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). 5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). 6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 7. Retinoblastoma. 8. Carcinoma of the breast. Cytoxan is also used in non-malignant disease: it is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid therapy or in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, Cytoxan may induce a remission. Cytoxan is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.@@NO@@@@@@@@@@@@When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of Cytoxan for patients with no hematologic deficiency usually consists of 40 to 50 mg/kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens include 10 to 15 mg/kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 to 5 mg/kg twice weekly. Many other regimens of intravenous and oral Cytoxan have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia. When Cytoxan is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose as well as that of the other drugs. Cytoxan and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of Cytoxan metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.@TGA, 1 November 1959@11/1/1959@@@@@Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities.

These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Cardiac Toxicity: Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium. No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Infections: Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@PBS@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE||||@PFIZER@@@@@PFIZER||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia@Acute Myeloid Leukaemia@Hodgkin's Lymphoma@Myeloma@Haematological Malignancy|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia|Acute Myeloid Leukaemia|Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Myeloma|||||@CYCLOBLASTIN@@@@@CYCLOBLASTIN||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@562.68@562.68@@50@0.7915@19.11@30.97@20.55@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@9/1/2017@0.38@0.38@1067-0556-GE-ZX@TABLET@A$@@@@@@@@50@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@23@Australia

Appropriate management of the therapy and its complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. Patients should be informed not only of the benefits of therapy but also that they will probably experience adverse reactions. Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14918196@Methotrexate is used in the treatment of adults with severe, active, classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis who are unresponsive or intolerant to conventional therapy. Methotrexate has also been used in the treatment of severe, uncontrolled psoriasis, which is not responsive to other therapy. Methotrexate has been used to produce regression in a wide range of neoplastic conditions including acute leukaemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue and osteogenic sarcomas, and solid tumours particularly breast, lung, head and neck, bladder, cervical, ovarian, and testicular carcinoma.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Dosage for cancer treatment: A test dose of 5 - 10 mg parenterally is recommended, one week prior to therapy to detect idiosyncratic adverse events. Single doses, not exceeding 30 mg/m2, on not more than 5 consecutive days. A rest period of at least two weeks is recommended between treatments, in order to allow the bone marrow to return to normal. Doses in excess of 100 mg are usually given parenterally, when the injectable preparation should be used. Doses in excess of 70 mg/m2 should not be administered without leucovorin rescue (folinic acid rescue) or assay of serum methotrexate levels 24 - 48 hours after dosing. If methotrexate is administered in combination chemotherapy regimens, the dosage should be reduced, taking into consideration any overlapping toxicity of the other drug components.@@@@@@@Methotrexate should be used with extreme caution in patients with haematological depression, renal impairment, diarrhoea, ulcerative disorders of the GI tract and psychiatric disorders. Hepatic toxicity has been observed, usually associated with chronic hepatic disease. Renal lesions may develop if the urinary flow is impeded and urinary pH is low, especially if large doses have been administered. The administration of low doses of methotrexate for prolonged periods may give rise, in particular, to hepatic toxicity.

The binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some but not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance gene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental antitumour activity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours.@@14923678@Breast Cancer: Taxotere is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

Close monitoring is essential, because some patients may rapidly become unresectable. Surgery is recommended if bleeding and/or symptoms are present. PET scans allow rapid assessment of imatinib therapy. Baseline CT with or without MRI followed by subsequent PET scans about 2-4 weeks after therapy should be considered to assess therapeutic effect. If there is no progression, resection should be considered, if possible (GIST-2). In stable and responding patients, imatinib therapy should be continued until maximal response, which may take 3-6 months. If there is progression, as confirmed with CT scan, surgery is recommended after discontinuing imatinib (GIST-2). Imatinib dosing can be stopped right before surgery and resumed as soon as the patient is able to tolerate oral medications following surgery.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects. The differences in potencies for carboplatin and cisplatin appear to be directly related to the difference in aquation rates.@@14920030@It is indicated for the initial treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma in established combination with other approved chemotherapeutics such as Paraplatin and cyclophosphamide.

In combination with cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2 IV on day 1 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles) for previously untreated patients, 300mg/m2 IV on day every 4 weeks for 6 cycles should be used. Suggested dose adjustments include 125% from prior course if platelet and neutrophil counts are above 100,000 and 2,000 respectively; no adjustment if the counts are 50-100,000 or 500-2,000 respectively; and 75% if they are under 50,000 and 500 respectively.@@@@@@@Bone marrow suppression (leukopaenia, neutropaenia, and thrombocytopaenia) is dose-dependent and is also the dose-limiting toxicity. Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor.

In clinical studies with a dosage of 12 mg/m2 daily for 5 days, patients who achieved a complete remission did so as a result of the first induction course.Combination Therapy: Mitoxantrone has been used in combination regimens for the treatment of acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL). Most clinical experience has been with mitoxantrone combined with cytarabine. This combination has been used successfully for primary treatment of ANLL as well as in the treatment of relapse. An effective regimen for induction in previously untreated patients has been mitoxantrone 10-12 mg/m2 IV for 3 days combined with cytarabine 100 mg/m2 IV for 7 days (by continuous infusion). This is followed by second induction and consolidation courses as thought appropriate by the treating clinician. In clinical studies, duration of therapy in induction and consolidation courses with mitoxantrone have been reduced to 2 days, and that of cytarabine to 5 days. However, modification to the above regimen should be carried out by the treating clinician depending on individual patient factors.@Jan-85@@1/1/2001@@@@There may be an increased risk of leukaemia when mitoxantrone is used as adjuvant treatment of non-metastatic breast cancer. In the absence of sufficient efficacy data, mitoxantrone must not be used as adjuvant treatment of non-metastatic breast cancer. Mitoxantrone should be used with caution in patients with myelosuppression or poor general condition. Cases of functional cardiac changes, including congestive heart failure and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction have been reported during mitoxantrone therapy. These cardiac events have occurred most commonly in patients who have had prior treatment with anthracyclines, prior mediastinal/thoracic radiotherapy, or in patients with pre-existing heart disease. The concomitant administration of other cardiotoxic drugs may also increase the risk of cardiac toxicity. It is recommended that patients in these categories are treated with mitoxantrone at full cytotoxic dosage and schedule. However, added caution is required in these patients and careful regular cardiac examinations are recommended from the initiation of treatment.@@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@HAUTE AUTORITÉ DE SANTÉ@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@MITOXANTRONE@@@@@MITOXANTRONE||||@WYETH@PFIZER@@@@WYETH|PFIZER|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Myeloid Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Myeloid Leukaemia||||||||@NOVANTRONE@@@@@NOVANTRONE||||@Cytotoxic Antibiotic@Anthracycline@Topoisomerase II Inhibitor@@@Cytotoxic Antibiotic|Anthracycline|Topoisomerase II Inhibitor||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@12@month@12 month@6693.75@6693.75@18.34@1@1.1511@229.5@@@@@@@@@@@@11.48@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/2/2017@229.5@229.5@9109827R@INJECTABLE SOLUTION FOR PERFUSION, 10 ML@EURO@@@@@@@@20@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@85@France

Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs.

This phenomenon is related to the drug's rapid inactivation and brief exposure of susceptible normal and neoplastic cells to significant levels after rapid injection. Normal and neoplastic cells seem to respond in somewhat parallel fashion to these different modes of administration and no clear-cut clinical advantage has been demonstrated for either. In the induction therapy of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, the usual cytarabine dose in combination with other anti-cancer drugs is 100 mg/m²/day by continuous IV infusion (Days 1-7) or 100 mg/m² IV every 12 hours (Days 1-7).

Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity.

Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Little or no binding was observed in the non-lymphoid tissues examined.@@16749475@Treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma in combination with chemotherapy.@@YES@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Roche announces US$43.7 billion proposal to assume full control of Genentech.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917804@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922273@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@382@Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in multiple myeloma - The recommended dose is 90 mg every 4 weeks.

Trastuzumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) culture containing the antibiotic gentamicin. Gentamicin is not detectable in the final product. The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Herceptin has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Herceptin is a mediator of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, Herceptin-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2@@14920488@Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC): Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2: a) as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease.

Hormone receptor positive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. b) in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable. c) in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. d) in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with hormone-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer, not previously treated with trastuzumab.   Early Breast Cancer (EBC): Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable). Herceptin should only be used in patients whose tumours have either HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay.  Herceptin in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-esophageal junction who have not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease.@@YES@19-Feb-02@2/19/2002@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Roche announces US$43.7 billion proposal to assume full control of Genentech.

Peak plasma concentrations of about 30ng/ml are attained approximately 1.5 hours after an 8mg dose. For doses above 8mg the increase in ondansetron systemic exposure with dose is greater than proportional; this may reflect some reduction in first pass metabolism at higher oral doses. Bioavailability, following oral administration, is slightly enhanced by the presence of food but unaffected by antacids. Studies in healthy elderly volunteers have shown slight, but clinically insignificant, age-related increases in both oral bioavailability (65%) and half-life (5 hours) of ondansetron. Gender differences were shown in the disposition of ondansetron, with females having a greater rate and extent of absorption following an oral dose and reduced systemic clearance and volume of distribution (adjusted for weight).  The disposition of ondansetron following oral, intramuscular(IM) and intravenous(IV) dosing is similar with a terminal half life of about 3 hours and steady state volume of distribution of about 140L.

Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917798@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14920116@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal. Pamidronate disodium therapy in patients with Paget's disease has been effective in reducing serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels by = 50% in at least 50% of patients, and by = 30% in at least 80% of patients. Pamidronate disodium therapy has also been effective in reducing these biochemical markers in patients with Paget's disease who failed to respond, or no longer responded to other treatments.

Administer for 10 days. Obtain daily blood counts. If no antileukaemic effect is noted and there is no apparent toxicity, increase to 4 mg/kg/day and maintain until therapeutic response or toxicity is evident. Almost all patients can be carried to toxicity with these doses. ii) 0.5  1.0 mg/kg/day may be given in an infusion of up to 24 hours duration. Results from onehour infusions have been satisfactory in the majority of patients. After 10 days this initial daily dose may be increased to 2 mg/kg/day subject to toxicity. Continue to toxicity or until remission occurs. b) Intermittent treatment: 3-5 mg/kg/day are administered intravenously on each of five consecutive days. After a two to nineday rest period, a further course is given. Continue until response or toxicity occurs. The first evidence of marrow improvement has been reported to occur 7  64 days (mean 28 days) after the beginning of therapy.

This difference is due to the rapid metabolism of Cytarabine and the consequent short duration of action of the high dose. 2) Maintenance therapy: Remissions which have been induced by Cytarabine, or by other drugs, may be maintained by intravenous or subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg once or twice weekly.@EMA, June 1999@@@@@@Only physicians experienced in cancer chemotherapy should use Cytarabine for Injection USP. For induction therapy, patients should be treated in a facility with laboratory and supportive resources sufficient to monitor drug tolerance and protect and maintain a patient compromised by drug toxicity. The main toxic effect of cytarabine is bone marrow suppression with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Less serious toxicity includes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, oral ulceration, and hepatic dysfunction. The physician must judge possible benefit to the patient against known toxic effects of this drug in considering the advisability of therapy with cytarabine.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919483@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922226@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@392@Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia; please see label for dosing ranges; the total dose of pamidronate disodium may be administered either in a single infusion or in multiple infusions over 2-4 consecutive days.

Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917826@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14920196@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated With Highly Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy: The recommended adult oral dosage is 24 mg given as three 8-mg tablets administered 30 minutes before the start of single-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

[Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1.1511@12.75@27.1@13.85@@@@@@@@@@1.28@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@12.75@12.75@8410803@SOLUTION FOR INJECTION IN PRE-FILLED SYRINGE, 0.5 ML@EURO@@@@@@@@10@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917500@A component of adjuvant therapy in patients with evidence of axillary node tumor involvement following resection of primary breast cancer.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@No tiering.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma.

In the absence of sufficient efficacy data, mitoxantrone must not be used as adjuvant treatment of non-metastatic breast cancer. Mitoxantrone should be used with caution in patients with myelosuppression or poor general condition. Cases of functional cardiac changes, including congestive heart failure and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction have been reported during mitoxantrone therapy. These cardiac events have occurred most commonly in patients who have had prior treatment with anthracyclines, prior mediastinal/thoracic radiotherapy, or in patients with pre-existing heart disease. The concomitant administration of other cardiotoxic drugs may also increase the risk of cardiac toxicity. It is recommended that patients in these categories are treated with mitoxantrone at full cytotoxic dosage and schedule.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14916909@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@YES@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@@-@-@-@392@Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia; please see label for dosing ranges; the total dose of pamidronate disodium may be administered either in a single infusion or in multiple infusions over 2-4 consecutive days.

14922768@Onco@@@@@300f1014ntsdm@@@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@L01AA01@L01A@NO@NEW YORK, NEW YORK@@@Cyclophosphamide is an antineoplastic agent which is converted in the body to an active alkylating metabolite. It also possesses marked immunosuppressant properties. The principal site of cyclophosphamide activation is the liver. The chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant activity of cyclophosphamide is thought to be mediated by the cytotoxic intermediates produced by activation by mixed function oxidases in hepatic microsomes. Non-enzymatic cleavage, possibly taking place in the tumour cells, results in the formulation of highly cytotoxic forms of the drug.@@14922768@Although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to Cytoxan treatment: 1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma. 2. Multiple myeloma. 3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (Cytoxan given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration). 4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). 5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). 6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 7. Retinoblastoma. 8. Carcinoma of the breast. Cytoxan is also used in non-malignant disease: it is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid therapy or in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, Cytoxan may induce a remission. Cytoxan is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.@@@@@@@@-@@@@@@When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of Cytoxan for patients with no hematologic deficiency usually consists of 40 to 50 mg/kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens include 10 to 15 mg/kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 to 5 mg/kg twice weekly. Many other regimens of intravenous and oral Cytoxan have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia. When Cytoxan is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose as well as that of the other drugs. Cytoxan and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of Cytoxan metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.@1-Nov-59@11/1/1959@@@@@Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoproliferative malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically. Urinary System: Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal. Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Cardiac Toxicity: Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium. No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Infections: Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@RAMQ@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE||||@BAXTER HEALTHCARE@@@@@BAXTER HEALTHCARE||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia@Acute Myeloid Leukaemia@Hodgkin's Lymphoma@Myeloma@Haematological Malignancy|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia|Acute Myeloid Leukaemia|Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Myeloma|||||@PROCYTOX@@@@@PROCYTOX||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@562.68@562.68@@200@0.7881@70.4@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@7/19/2017@0.35@0.35@2241795200@TABLET@C$@@@@@@@@25@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@49@Canada

Almost all patients can be carried to toxicity with these doses. ii) 0.5  1.0 mg/kg/day may be given in an infusion of up to 24 hours duration. Results from onehour infusions have been satisfactory in the majority of patients. After 10 days this initial daily dose may be increased to 2 mg/kg/day subject to toxicity. Continue to toxicity or until remission occurs. b) Intermittent treatment: 3-5 mg/kg/day are administered intravenously on each of five consecutive days. After a two to nineday rest period, a further course is given. Continue until response or toxicity occurs. The first evidence of marrow improvement has been reported to occur 7  64 days (mean 28 days) after the beginning of therapy. In general, if a patient shows neither toxicity nor remission after a fair trial, the cautious administration of higher doses is warranted. As a rule, patients have been seen to tolerate higher doses when given by rapid intravenous injection as compared with slow infusion. This difference is due to the rapid metabolism of Cytarabine and the consequent short duration of action of the high dose. 2) Maintenance therapy: Remissions which have been induced by Cytarabine, or by other drugs, may be maintained by intravenous or subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg once or twice weekly.@Sep-87@@@@@@Only physicians experienced in cancer chemotherapy should use Cytarabine for Injection USP. For induction therapy, patients should be treated in a facility with laboratory and supportive resources sufficient to monitor drug tolerance and protect and maintain a patient compromised by drug toxicity. The main toxic effect of cytarabine is bone marrow suppression with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Less serious toxicity includes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, oral ulceration, and hepatic dysfunction. The physician must judge possible benefit to the patient against known toxic effects of this drug in considering the advisability of therapy with cytarabine.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922232@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@392@Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia; please see label for dosing ranges; the total dose of pamidronate disodium may be administered either in a single infusion or in multiple infusions over 2-4 consecutive days.

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919623@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@0%@-@-@-@357@Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated With Highly Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy: The recommended adult oral dosage is 24 mg given as three 8-mg tablets administered 30 minutes before the start of single-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917805@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

14917317@Onco@@@@@300f1014ntsdm@300f1813ntsdm@@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@NO@NEW YORK, NEW YORK@@@Cyclophosphamide is an antineoplastic agent which is converted in the body to an active alkylating metabolite. It also possesses marked immunosuppressant properties. The principal site of cyclophosphamide activation is the liver. The chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant activity of cyclophosphamide is thought to be mediated by the cytotoxic intermediates produced by activation by mixed function oxidases in hepatic microsomes. Non-enzymatic cleavage, possibly taking place in the tumour cells, results in the formulation of highly cytotoxic forms of the drug.@@14917317@Although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to Cytoxan treatment: 1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma. 2. Multiple myeloma. 3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (Cytoxan given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration). 4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). 5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). 6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 7. Retinoblastoma. 8. Carcinoma of the breast. Cytoxan is also used in non-malignant disease: it is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid therapy or in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, Cytoxan may induce a remission. Cytoxan is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.@@@@@@@@-@@@@@@When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of Cytoxan for patients with no hematologic deficiency usually consists of 40 to 50 mg/kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens include 10 to 15 mg/kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 to 5 mg/kg twice weekly. Many other regimens of intravenous and oral Cytoxan have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia. When Cytoxan is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose as well as that of the other drugs. Cytoxan and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of Cytoxan metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.@1-Nov-59@11/1/1959@@@@@Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoproliferative malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically. Urinary System: Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal. Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Cardiac Toxicity: Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium. No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Infections: Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@RAMQ@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE||||@BMS@@@@@BMS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@Breast Cancer@Ovarian Cancer@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia|Breast Cancer|Ovarian Cancer||||||@CYTOXAN@@@@@CYTOXAN||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@100@0.7934@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@INJECTION@C$@@@@@@@@25@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@49@Canada

In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumor cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922093@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases.

Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal.

A lower initial dosage (12 mg/m2 or less) is recommended for patients with inadequate bone marrow reserves e.g. due to prior chemotherapy or poor general condition. Combination Therapy: Mitoxantrone has been given as part of combination therapy. In metastatic breast cancer, combinations of mitoxantrone with other cytotoxic agents including cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil, or methotrexate and mitomycin C, have been shown to be effective. Reference should be made to the published literature for information on dosage modifications and administration. Mitoxantrone has also been used in various combinations for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, however data are presently limited and specific regimens cannot be recommended. As a guide, when mitoxantrone is used in combination chemotherapy with another myelosuppressive agent, the initial dose of mitoxantrone should be reduced by 2-4 mg/m2 below the doses recommended for single agent use. Subsequent doses, as outlined in the table above, depend on the degree and duration of myelosuppression.@Jan-85@@1/1/2001@@@@There may be an increased risk of leukaemia when mitoxantrone is used as adjuvant treatment of non-metastatic breast cancer. In the absence of sufficient efficacy data, mitoxantrone must not be used as adjuvant treatment of non-metastatic breast cancer. Mitoxantrone should be used with caution in patients with myelosuppression or poor general condition. Cases of functional cardiac changes, including congestive heart failure and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction have been reported during mitoxantrone therapy. These cardiac events have occurred most commonly in patients who have had prior treatment with anthracyclines, prior mediastinal/thoracic radiotherapy, or in patients with pre-existing heart disease. The concomitant administration of other cardiotoxic drugs may also increase the risk of cardiac toxicity. It is recommended that patients in these categories are treated with mitoxantrone at full cytotoxic dosage and schedule. However, added caution is required in these patients and careful regular cardiac examinations are recommended from the initiation of treatment.@@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@HAUTE AUTORITÉ DE SANTÉ@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@MITOXANTRONE@@@@@MITOXANTRONE||||@WYETH@PFIZER@@@@WYETH|PFIZER|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@Breast Cancer@Liver Cancer@Hepatocellular Carcinoma@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Breast Cancer|Liver Cancer|Hepatocellular Carcinoma|||||@NOVANTRONE@@@@@NOVANTRONE||||@Cytotoxic Antibiotic@Anthracycline@Topoisomerase II Inhibitor@@@Cytotoxic Antibiotic|Anthracycline|Topoisomerase II Inhibitor||@@@@@@@@@@@METASTATIC@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@12@month@12 month@@@@1@1.1511@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@9109833R@INJECTABLE SOLUTION FOR PERFUSION, 12.5 ML@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@85@France

Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately. Psychiatric intervention and/or drug discontinuation should be considered in such cases. Ophthalmologic: As with other interferons, retinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis and optic neuropathy which may result in loss of vision, have been reported after treatment with Roferon-A. Any patient complaining of decrease or loss of vision must have an eye examination. Because these ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual examination prior to initiation of Roferon-A monotherapy or in the combination therapy with ribavirin is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects. The differences in potencies for carboplatin and cisplatin appear to be directly related to the difference in aquation rates.@@14920003@It is indicated for the initial treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma in established combination with other approved chemotherapeutics such as Paraplatin and cyclophosphamide.

In combination with cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2 IV on day 1 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles) for previously untreated patients, 300mg/m2 IV on day every 4 weeks for 6 cycles should be used. Suggested dose adjustments include 125% from prior course if platelet and neutrophil counts are above 100,000 and 2,000 respectively; no adjustment if the counts are 50-100,000 or 500-2,000 respectively; and 75% if they are under 50,000 and 500 respectively.@@@@@@@Bone marrow suppression (leukopaenia, neutropaenia, and thrombocytopaenia) is dose-dependent and is also the dose-limiting toxicity. Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917499@A component of adjuvant therapy in patients with evidence of axillary node tumor involvement following resection of primary breast cancer.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@No tiering.

Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose.

Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism.

The study showed that patients treated with Lenvima lived on average 14.7 months longer without their disease progressing than patients treated with placebo.A large proportion of people receiving Lenvima during the studies needed to reduce the dose or interrupt treatment because of side effects (mainly high blood pressure and excess protein in the urine). Overall EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) considered that Lenvima has a safety profile which is consistent with other similar therapies and that side effects were predictable and manageable. However, the CHMP has requested a further study to investigate the most appropriate starting dose of Lenvima to optimise the benefits and reduce risks for patients who will be treated with the medicine.The opinion adopted by the CHMP at its March 2015 meeting is an intermediary step on Lenvima's path to patient access. The CHMP opinion will now be sent to the European Commission for the adoption of a decision on EU-wide marketing authorisation.

Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose.

Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma.

The binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some but not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance gene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental antitumour activity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours.@@14923707@Breast Cancer: Taxotere is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy.

Methotrexate has been used to produce regression in a wide range of neoplastic conditions including acute leukaemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue and osteogenic sarcomas, and solid tumours particularly breast, lung, head and neck, bladder, cervical, ovarian, and testicular carcinoma.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Acquired via takeover of generics unit of Merck KGaA@@@@Dosage for cancer treatment: A test dose of 5 - 10 mg parenterally is recommended, one week prior to therapy to detect idiosyncratic adverse events. Single doses, not exceeding 30 mg/m2, on not more than 5 consecutive days. A rest period of at least two weeks is recommended between treatments, in order to allow the bone marrow to return to normal. Doses in excess of 100 mg are usually given parenterally, when the injectable preparation should be used. Doses in excess of 70 mg/m2 should not be administered without leucovorin rescue (folinic acid rescue) or assay of serum methotrexate levels 24 - 48 hours after dosing. If methotrexate is administered in combination chemotherapy regimens, the dosage should be reduced, taking into consideration any overlapping toxicity of the other drug components.@@@@@@@Methotrexate should be used with extreme caution in patients with haematological depression, renal impairment, diarrhoea, ulcerative disorders of the GI tract and psychiatric disorders. Hepatic toxicity has been observed, usually associated with chronic hepatic disease. Renal lesions may develop if the urinary flow is impeded and urinary pH is low, especially if large doses have been administered. The administration of low doses of methotrexate for prolonged periods may give rise, in particular, to hepatic toxicity.

Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@1@RAMQ@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HOSPIRA@@@@@HOSPIRA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@100@0.7881@214.55@@@@@@@@@@@@0.21@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@7/19/2017@2.15@2.15@2182750100@TABLET@C$@@@@@@@@10@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@49@Canada

Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production.

Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A.

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor.

14921157@Onco@@@@@300f1012ntsdm@@@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@N02AB03@N02A@YES@ZURICH, SWITZERLAND@@@Fentanyl is a synthetic opiate with a clinical potency of 50 to 100 times that of morphine. Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14921157@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@NYCOMED@@@@@NYCOMED||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@MATRIFEN@@@@@MATRIFEN||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@9@1.1511@80.73@113.05@83.97@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@8.97@8.97@7331042@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@50@MCG@50 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918394@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@ESPARMA@@@@@ESPARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@2183200@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MCG@25 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919898@1.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922934@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919350@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Cytosar-U may be given by intravenous infusion or injection, subcutaneously, or intrathecally. Patients can tolerate higher total doses when they receive the drug by rapid intravenous injection as compared with slow infusion. This phenomenon is related to the drug's rapid inactivation and brief exposure of susceptible normal and neoplastic cells to significant levels after rapid injection. Normal and neoplastic cells seem to respond in somewhat parallel fashion to these different modes of administration and no clear-cut clinical advantage has been demonstrated for either. In the induction therapy of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, the usual cytarabine dose in combination with other anti-cancer drugs is 100 mg/m²/day by continuous IV infusion (Days 1-7) or 100 mg/m² IV every 12 hours (Days 1-7). Cytosar-U has been used intrathecally in acute leukemia in doses ranging from 5 mg/m² to 75 mg/m² of body surface area. The frequency of administration varied from once a day for 4 days to once every 4 days. The most frequently used dose was 30 mg/m² every 4 days until cerebrospinal fluid findings were normal, followed by one additional treatment. The dosage schedule is usually governed by the type and severity of central nervous system manifestations and the response to previous therapy.@@@@@@@Only physicians experienced in cancer chemotherapy should use Cytarabine for Injection USP.

T-cells and STAT transcription factors play significant functional roles in a range of biological processes that are particularly relevant to oral mucositis as a clinical indication for SCV-07. Radiation- and chemotherapy-associated toxicities have been associated with a shift in Th1 to Th2 helper cell ratios to highly favor Th2 cells and increases in STAT3; SCV-07 has been shown to shift the Th1 to Th2 ratio back to favor the Th1 state and to inhibit STAT3-dependant responses. Additional preclinical studies with SCV-07 are ongoing in other indications that could also benefit from this change in Th1/Th2 ratio, including various immune-sensitive cancers, asthma, and viral infections such as those from papilloma and herpes viruses. The decrease in growth of tumors and increase in survival rates seen in these preclinical cancer models suggest that the use of SCV-07 in this new clinical study, i.e., the prevention of radio-chemotherapy induced oral mucositis, could also have the added benefit of positive effects against the primary tumor. @@14916485@SCV-07 for the Delay to Onset of Severe Oral Mucositis in Patients Receiving Chemoradiation Therapy for Head and Neck Cancer (SCV-07 OM)@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00756951@60@-@-@@@-@@9/1/2008@-@SCV-07 OM@@-@>> Subject must have a body weight less than 150 kg at screening              >> Have recently-diagnosed, pathologically-confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx or larynx that will be treated with chemoradiation therapy(postoperative patients are eligible, if surgery is < 6 weeks prior to initiation of radiotherapy.             >> Plan to receive a continuous course of conventional external beam irradiation                 >>Plan to receive a standard cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimen@@@II@II@@-@-@>> First patient in.

The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@RATIOPHARM@@@@@RATIOPHARM||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@18.39@34.24@19.67@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@3.68@3.68@2922583@SOLUTION FOR INJECTION 10 ML@EURO@@@@@@@@500@MCG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917806@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@ABZ PHARMA@@@@@ABZ PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@9.43@22.91@10.43@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@1.89@1.89@4103582@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@12@MCG@12 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor.

This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro. Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma.@@16446253@VELCADE in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.@Both@YES@6-Jan-16@1/6/2016@NO REVIEW@@@@100%@@FIRST-LINE@NCT00722137@487@VELCADE 1 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via intravenous injection at the recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, followed by a 10-day rest period on days 12-21.

Rest and physiotherapy as indicated should be continued.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Via UDL Labs unit@@@@Choriocarcinoma and similar trophoblastic diseases: Methotrexate is administered orally or intramuscularly in doses of 15 to 30 mg daily for a five-day course. Such courses are usually repeated for 3 to 5 times as required, with rest periods of one or more weeks interposed between courses, until any manifesting toxic symptoms subside.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@N/A@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@MYLAN@UDL LABS@@@@MYLAN|UDL LABS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Endometrial Cancer@Breast Cancer@NSCLC@Head & Neck Cancer@@Endometrial Cancer|Breast Cancer|NSCLC|Head & Neck Cancer||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1@5.2@@@@@@@@@@@@2.08@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/2/2017@5.2@5.2@51079-0670-01@TABLET@US$@@@@@@@@2.5@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

VEGF and PDGF are growth factors critical to the development and growth of blood vessels - a process known as angiogenesis. Angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in the growth and spread of several tumour types, with VEGF and PDGF overexpression linked to multiple cancers including cancers of the liver, lung, breast, kidney, bladder, ovaries, and colon. By inhibiting VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-kit pazopanib may stop or slow the rate of tumour growth and development. Pazopanib is currently being studied in a number of different tumour types; clinical trials are currently underway in renal cell carcinoma (Phase III), breast cancer (Phase III in inflammatory breast cancer), ovarian cancer, STS, NSCLC, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.

High doses of MTX can cause kidney damage in some cancer patients and this can delay the elimination of MTX from the body. Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of MTX commonly results in serious toxic effects such as mucositis (painful mouth sores), reduced platelet and white blood counts (myelosuppression) , kidney failure and an increased risk of sepsis and in some instances death. A number of cancer patients die every year from MTX induced toxicity, typically due to sepsis.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922223@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@392@Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia; please see label for dosing ranges; the total dose of pamidronate disodium may be administered either in a single infusion or in multiple infusions over 2-4 consecutive days.

Appropriate management of the therapy and its complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. Patients should be informed not only of the benefits of therapy but also that they will probably experience adverse reactions. Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately. Psychiatric intervention and/or drug discontinuation should be considered in such cases. Ophthalmologic: As with other interferons, retinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis and optic neuropathy which may result in loss of vision, have been reported after treatment with Roferon-A. Any patient complaining of decrease or loss of vision must have an eye examination.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@-@-@@@-@APPROVED@@@SSN@NO LABELLED TRIAL@-@@@@-@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@@JANSSEN CILAG||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@DUROGESIC@@@@@DUROGESIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@-@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@-@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@3@1.1807@22.48@37.1@23.49@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/31/2017@7.49@7.49@29212077@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@1800@MCG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@119@Italy

Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

MultiStem is a biologic product that consists of undifferentiated human stem cells obtained from adult bone marrow or other nonembryonic tissue sources.  The cells may be produced on a large scale for future clinical use and stored in frozen form until needed.  Material from a single qualified donor may be used to produce hundreds of thousands or even millions of clinical doses of MultiStem, which are extensively characterized to ensure product consistency and safety. It is considered to have potential as a “best-in-class” cell therapy based on its ability to deliver therapeutic benefit through multiple mechanisms of action, its ability to be delivered “off-the-shelf” like a pharmaceutical product and its safety profile. Though the cells have the potential to differentiate into a variety of cell types, in certain indications the primary mechanism of MultiStem appears to be the production of a physiologically relevant and complex set of therapeutic molecules in response to the local environment. In the initial indications Athersys is pursuing, the cells appear to minimize the inflammatory reaction that occurs in response to ischemic events (such as myocardial infarction or stroke) or the anti-host immune reaction seen in graft vs. host disease (GvHD), and promote recovery.MultiStem's ability to be delivered “off the shelf” like a traditional pharmaceutical is based on: Scalability - The product can be produced efficiently and consistently in large quantities and stored (frozen) for subsequent use; Minimal immunogenicity - In contrast to conventional bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplants, preclinical studies have shown that MultiStem may be used without tissue matching (i.e., not immunogenic) or immunosuppression, making it analogous to type “O” blood; Multiple approaches to delivery -  MultiStem may be delivered systemically (e.g. I.V.) or local administration   (e.g. using a catheter based delivery system), depending on the disease indication and the specific needs of the patient@@14921185@Patients with acute leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, or myelodysplasia after they have received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00677859@36@-@-@@@-@@@-@GVHD-2007-001@@FEBRUARY 2009 (NCE); FEBRUARY 2011 (ORPHAN)@Patients of either sex aged 18-60 years of age.Diagnosis of acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia (second or subsequent remission, if not in remission, then <20% bone marrow blasts), chronic myelogenous leukemia resistant to or intolerant of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (accelerated phase, first chronic phase with TKI resistance, or second chronic phase), or myelodysplastic syndrome (intermediate/high or high risk by International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), lower risk by IPSS with patient having progressed after prior therapy.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919576@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922939@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Ibritumomab tiuxetan targets the antigen CD20 which is located on the surface of malignant and normal B-lymphocytes . During B-cell maturation, CD20 is first expressed in the midstage of B-lymphoblast (pre-B-cell), and is lost during the final stage of B-cell maturation to plasma cells. It is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalise on antibody binding. The conjugated antibody has an apparent affinity constant for the CD20 antigen of approximately 17 nM. The binding pattern is very restricted, with no cross-reactivity to other leukocytes or to other types of human tissue. [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin binds specifically to B-cells, including CD20-expressing malignant cells. The isotope yttrium-90 is a pure ß-emitter and has a mean path length of about 5 mm.

It also possesses marked immunosuppressant properties. The principal site of cyclophosphamide activation is the liver. The chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant activity of cyclophosphamide is thought to be mediated by the cytotoxic intermediates produced by activation by mixed function oxidases in hepatic microsomes. Non-enzymatic cleavage, possibly taking place in the tumour cells, results in the formulation of highly cytotoxic forms of the drug.@@14917232@Although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to Cytoxan treatment: 1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma. 2. Multiple myeloma. 3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (Cytoxan given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration). 4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). 5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). 6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 7. Retinoblastoma. 8. Carcinoma of the breast. Cytoxan is also used in non-malignant disease: it is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid therapy or in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, Cytoxan may induce a remission. Cytoxan is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of Cytoxan for patients with no hematologic deficiency usually consists of 40 to 50 mg/kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens include 10 to 15 mg/kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 to 5 mg/kg twice weekly. Many other regimens of intravenous and oral Cytoxan have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia. When Cytoxan is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose as well as that of the other drugs. Cytoxan and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of Cytoxan metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.@FDA, 16 November 1959@11/16/1959@@@@@Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoproliferative malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically. Urinary System: Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal. Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Cardiac Toxicity: Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium. No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Infections: Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE||||@BMS@@@@@BMS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@Breast Cancer@Ovarian Cancer@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia|Breast Cancer|Ovarian Cancer||||||@CYTOXAN@@@@@CYTOXAN||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@1@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@00015-0502-41@POWDER FOR INJECTION FOR RECONSTITUTION@US$@@@@@@@@500@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer. Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs (PDGFR, RET, or KIT) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRß- and VEGFR2-dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo.@@15299362@Well-differentiated pancreatic islet cell tumours@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Acquired through takeover of Pharmacia Corp., which acquired it from Sugen@@NCT00428597@340@@FDA, 20 May 2011@5/20/2011@@@@3/1/2007@@A6181111@No@JANUARY 2011 (NCE EXCLUSIVITY); FEBRUARY 2021 (GIST PATENT)@@@@III@APPROVED@@@@Data from the trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed SUTENT more than doubled median PFS compared with placebo (11.4 versus 5.5 months, p<0.0001), which was found to be consistent in a blinded, independent central review of scans from the study (12.6 versus 5.8 months, p=0.000015).

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@RATIOPHARM@@@@@RATIOPHARM||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@25.68@43.45@27.19@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@2.57@2.57@2512282@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@12@MCG@12 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that exposure of CLL lymphocytes to 2F-ara-A triggers extensive DNA fragmentation and cell death characteristic of apoptosis.@@14917909@Treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in patients with sufficient bone marrow reserves.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms.

[Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Leukemia: When used for induction, methotrexate in doses of 3.3 mg/m2 in combination with 60 mg/m2 of prednisone, given daily, produced remissions in 50% of patients treated, usually within a period of 4 to 6 weeks. Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia||||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1.1511@4.35@16.48@5.18@@@@@@@@@@0.44@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@4.35@4.35@8530996@SOLUTION FOR INJECTION (4 ML)@EURO@@@@@@@@10@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

Interferon alfa-2a (Roferon-A) may be active in patients who have progressive disease and who are refractory to, or unsuitable for, conventional therapy; Adult patients with histologically proven chronic hepatitis B who have markers for viral replication, i.e., those who are positive for HBV-DNA or HBeAg; Adult patients with histologically proven chronic hepatitis C who are positive for HCV antibodies or HCV RNA and have elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) without liver decompensation. The efficacy of interferon alfa-2a in the treatment of hepatitis C is enhanced when combined with ribavirin. Roferon-A should be given alone mainly in case of intolerance or contra-indication to ribavirin; Follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Advanced renal cell carcinoma; Patients with AJCC Stage II malignant melanoma (Breslow tumour thickness> 1.5mm, no lymph node involvement or cutaneous spread) who are free of disease after surgery.@@NO@February 2004 (P) & december 2004(H)@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@AIDS-RELATED KAPOSI'S SARCOMA - Initial dosage: Roferon-A should be given by subcutaneous injection, and escalated to at least 18 million IU daily and if possible to 36 million IU daily for a total of ten to twelve weeks in patients of 18 years or older. The recommended escalation schedule is as follows: Days 1 – 3 3 million IU daily; Days 4 – 6 9 million IU daily; Days 7 – 9 18 million IU daily and, if tolerated, increase to: Days 10 – 84 36 million IU daily. Maintenance dosage: Roferon-A should be given by subcutaneous injection three times per week at the maximum dose which is acceptable to the patient, but not exceeding 36 million IU. Patients with AIDSrelated Kaposi's sarcoma treated with 3 million IU of Roferon-A given daily showed a lower response rate than those treated with the recommended dosage.@1-Nov-99@11/1/1999@10/14/2000@@@@Roferon-A should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the management of the respective indication. Appropriate management of the therapy and its complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. Patients should be informed not only of the benefits of therapy but also that they will probably experience adverse reactions. Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately. Psychiatric intervention and/or drug discontinuation should be considered in such cases. Ophthalmologic: As with other interferons, retinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis and optic neuropathy which may result in loss of vision, have been reported after treatment with Roferon-A. Any patient complaining of decrease or loss of vision must have an eye examination. Because these ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual examination prior to initiation of Roferon-A monotherapy or in the combination therapy with ribavirin is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Roferon-A monotherapy or the combination therapy with ribavirin should be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmologic disorders.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@HAUTE AUTORITÉ DE SANTÉ@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@INTERFERON ALPHA-2A@@@@@INTERFERON ALPHA-2A||||@ROCHE@@@@@ROCHE||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Kaposi's Sarcoma@Melanoma / Skin Cancer@Kidney Cancer@@@Kaposi's Sarcoma|Melanoma / Skin Cancer|Kidney Cancer|||||||@ROFERON A@@@@@ROFERON A||||@Immunotherapy@Interferon@@@@Immunotherapy|Interferon|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1.1511@56.17@69.82@59.92@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@56.17@56.17@3.40E+12@SOLUTION FOR INJECTION (SC), PRE-FILLED SYRINGE, 0.5 ML@EURO@@@@@@@@9@MUI@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@85@France

Additionally, imatinib is recommended as an option for people who present in the chronic phase and then progress to the accelerated phase or blast crisis if they have not received imatinib previously. 1.3 There is currently no evidence on clinical and cost effectiveness on which to base guidance on the continued use of imatinib that has been initiated in the chronic phase of CML but has failed to stop disease progression to either the accelerated phase or blast crisis. Therefore, under these circumstances the use of imatinib is recommended only in the context of further clinical study. The data for this study should be collected systematically to allow aggregation and analysis at a national level in order to inform the appraisal review. 1.4 For people in chronic-phase CML who are currently receiving interferon alpha (IFN-a) as first-line treatment, the decision about whether to change to imatinib should be informed by the response of the disease to current treatment and by the tolerance of the person to IFN-a.

Elevations of neutrophil counts are dosedependent at recommended doses. Neutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919903@1.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

The differences in potencies for carboplatin and cisplatin appear to be directly related to the difference in aquation rates.@@14919716@Indicated for the treatment of: 1. advanced ovarian carcinoma of epithelial origin in  (a) first line therapy (b) second line therapy, after other treatments have failed. 2. small cell carcinoma of the lung.@@YES@@@NO REVIEW@@@@60%@@FIRST-LINE@@789@Single-Agent Therapy: has been shown to be effective in patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma at a dosage of 360 mg/m2 I.V. on day 1 every 4 weeks (alternatively see Formula Dosing).

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor.

When bound to the polymer, paclitaxel is rendered inactive, potentially sparing normal tissue's exposure to high levels of the active drug and its associated toxicities. Blood vessels in tumor tissue, unlike blood vessels in normal tissue, are porous to molecules like polyglutamate. Based on preclinical studies, it appears that Opaxio is preferentially distributed to tumors due to their leaky blood vessels and trapped in the tumor bed allowing significantly more of the dose of chemotherapy to localize in the tumor than with standard paclitaxel. Once inside the tumor cell, enzymes metabolize the protein polymer, releasing the paclitaxel chemotherapy. Preclinical and clinical studies support that Opaxio metabolism by lung cancer cells may be influenced by estrogen, which could lead to enhanced release of paclitaxel and efficacy in women with lung cancer compared to standard therapies.

Patients will comprise two groups receiving Reolysin, either at an early (21 to 10 days) or late time point (less than 10 days) before surgical resection. After surgery, the tumour and surrounding liver tissue will be assessed for viral status and anti-tumour effects. [Oncolytics]@@-@-@-@CALGARY, CANADA@@@Reolysin, a proprietary formulation of the human reovirus, has been demonstrated to replicate specifically in tumour cells bearing an activated Ras pathway. Activating mutations of Ras and upstream elements of Ras may play a role in greater than two thirds of all human cancers. Reolysin may represent a novel treatment for Ras activated tumour cells and some cellular proliferative disorders. Reovirus, an acronym for Respiratory Enteric Orphan virus, is generally believed to inhabit the respiratory and bowel systems in humans. Reovirus is found naturally in sewage and water supplies. By age 12, half of all children show evidence of reovirus exposure and by adulthood, most people have been exposed. However, the disease is non-pathogenic, meaning there are typically no symptoms from infections. The link to its cancer-killing ability was established after the reovirus was discovered to reproduce well in various cancer cell lines. Tumours bearing an activated Ras pathway are deficient in their ability to activate the anti-viral response mediated by the host cellular protein, PKR. Since PKR is responsible for preventing reovirus replication, tumour cells lacking the activity of PKR are susceptible to reovirus replication. As normal cells do not possess Ras activations, these cells are able to stop reovirus infection through normal PKR activity. In tumour cells with an activated Ras pathway, reovirus is able to freely replicate and eventually kill the host tumour cells. As cell death occurs, progeny virus particles are then free to infect surrounding cancer cells. This cycle of infection, replication and cell death is believed to be repeated until there are no longer any tumour cells carrying an activated Ras pathway available.@@14916572@Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer prior to surgical resection of liver metastases@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@-@20@-@-@@@-@@2/1/2009@-@REO-013@@-@-@@@II@II@@-@-@>> Enrolment started.

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14920249@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses. Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: indicated in the management of selected adults with severe, active, rheumatoid arthritis (ARC criteria), or children with active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate.

Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@N/A@@@-@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@-@-@@@-@APPROVED@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@-@@@@-@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@WYETH@PFIZER@@@@WYETH|PFIZER|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@-@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@-@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1.1229@24.69@40.75@25.8@@@@@@@@@@0.05@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@6/7/2017@24.69@24.69@19888092@PREPARATION FOR INJECTION (VIAL, 20 ML)@EURO@@@@@@@@500@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@119@Italy

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922941@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

In more severe diseases, doses higher than 9mg may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until the patient's response is satisfactory. Both the dose in the evening, which is useful in alleviating morning stiffness, and the divided dosage regimen are associated with greater suppression of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. If satisfactory clinical response does not occur after a reasonable period of time, discontinue treatment with dexamethasone and transfer the patient to another therapy. If the initial response is favourable, the maintenance dosage should be determined by lowering the dose gradually to the lowest dose required to maintain an adequate clinical response. Chronic dosage should preferably not exceed 1.5mg dexamethasone daily. The following dosage schedule combining parenteral and oral therapy is suggested: First day: Dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection 4mg or 8mg (1ml or 2ml) intramuscularly.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@-@-@@@-@APPROVED@@@SSN@NO LABELLED TRIAL@-@@@@-@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@@JANSSEN CILAG||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@DUROGESIC@@@@@DUROGESIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@-@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@-@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@3@1.1807@16.25@26.82@16.98@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/31/2017@5.42@5.42@29212065@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@1200@MCG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@119@Italy

The higher dosage ranges (0.4 mg to 0.6 mg) are usually employed for hepatic artery infusion because the liver metabolizes the drug, thus reducing the potential for systemic toxicity. Therapy can be given until adverse reactions appear. When these side effects have subsided, therapy may be resumed. The patient should be maintained on therapy as long as response to FUDR continues. Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been published. 1 - 6 There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.@@@@@@@Because of the possibility of severe toxic reactions, all patients should be hospitalized for initiation of the first course of therapy. FUDR should be used with extreme caution in poor risk patients with impaired hepatic or renal function or a history of high-dose pelvic irradiation or previous use of alkylating agents. The drug is not intended as an adjuvant to surgery. FUDR may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. It has been shown to be teratogenic in the chick embryo, mouse (at doses of 2.5 to 100 mg/kg) and rat (at doses of 75 to 150 mg/kg). Malformations included cleft palates; skeletal defects; and deformed appendages, paws and tails. The dosages which were teratogenic in animals are 4.2 to 125 times the recommended human therapeutic dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with FUDR in pregnant women. Combination Therapy: Any form of therapy which adds to the stress of the patient, interferes with nutrition or depresses bone marrow function will increase the toxicity of FUDR.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@NO REVIEW@SNS@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FLOXURIDINE@@@@@FLOXURIDINE||||@HOSPIRA@@@@@HOSPIRA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Liver Cancer@Stomach Cancer@@@@Liver Cancer|Stomach Cancer||||||||@FUDRT@@@@@FUDRT||||@Anti-metabolite@Pyrimidine Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Pyrimidine Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@METASTATIC@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@@1.1511@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@INJECTION@EURO@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@217@Spain

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917809@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

It also possesses marked immunosuppressant properties. The principal site of cyclophosphamide activation is the liver. The chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant activity of cyclophosphamide is thought to be mediated by the cytotoxic intermediates produced by activation by mixed function oxidases in hepatic microsomes. Non-enzymatic cleavage, possibly taking place in the tumour cells, results in the formulation of highly cytotoxic forms of the drug.@@14917227@Although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to Cytoxan treatment: 1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma. 2. Multiple myeloma. 3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (Cytoxan given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration). 4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). 5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). 6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 7. Retinoblastoma. 8. Carcinoma of the breast. Cytoxan is also used in non-malignant disease: it is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid therapy or in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, Cytoxan may induce a remission. Cytoxan is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of Cytoxan for patients with no hematologic deficiency usually consists of 40 to 50 mg/kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens include 10 to 15 mg/kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 to 5 mg/kg twice weekly. Many other regimens of intravenous and oral Cytoxan have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia. When Cytoxan is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose as well as that of the other drugs. Cytoxan and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of Cytoxan metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.@FDA, 16 November 1959@11/16/1959@@@@@Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoproliferative malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically. Urinary System: Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal. Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Cardiac Toxicity: Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium. No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Infections: Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE||||@BMS@@@@@BMS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia@Acute Myeloid Leukaemia@Hodgkin's Lymphoma@Myeloma@Haematological Malignancy|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia|Acute Myeloid Leukaemia|Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Myeloma|||||@CYTOXAN@@@@@CYTOXAN||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@1@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@00015-0506-41@POWDER FOR INJECTION FOR RECONSTITUTION@US$@@@@@@@@2@G@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

Cell culture studies have demonstrated rapid cell penetration and perinucleolar chromatin binding, rapid inhibition of mitotic activity and nucleic acid synthesis, mutagenesis and chromosomal aberrations. The specificity of doxorubicin toxicity appears to be related primarily to proliferative activity of normal tissue. Thus, bone marrow, gastro-intestinal tract and gonads are the main normal tissues damaged.@@14916307@Doxorubicin has been used successfully in the treatment of neoplastic conditions such as acute leukaemia, soft tissue and osteogenic sarcomas, breast carcinoma, lymphomas, bronchogenic (lung) carcinoma. It has also been used in the treatment of paediatric malignancy. Doxorubicin is frequently used in combination chemotherapy regimen involving other cytotoxic drugs.

Myocardial toxicity manifested in its most severe form by potentially fatal congestive heart failure may occur either during therapy or months to years after termination of therapy. The probability of developing impaired myocardial function based on a combined index of signs, symptoms and decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is estimated to be 1 to 2% at a total cumulative dose of 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin, 3 to 5% at a dose of 400 mg/m2, 5 to 8% at 450 mg/m2 and 6 to 20% at 500 mg/m2.

Secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has been reported in patients treated with anthracyclines, including doxorubicin. The occurrence of refractory secondary AML or MDS is more common when anthracyclines are given in combination with DNA-damaging anti-neoplastic agents or radiotherapy, when patients have been heavily pretreated with cytotoxic drugs, or when doses of anthracyclines have been escalated.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14920114@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases.

Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia.

Moreover, with 5 years of follow-up, 12 of 20 patients (60%) in the Genasense group who achieved CR are alive, 5 of these patients remain in continuous CR without relapse, and 2 additional patients have relapsed but have not required additional therapy.  By contrast, only 3 of 8 CR patients in the chemotherapy-only group are alive, all 3 have relapsed, and all 3 have required additional anti-leukemic treatment. SOURCE: Genta, 29 May 2008Patients who achieved complete remission (the primary endpoint of the trial) with Genasense plus chemotherapy have shown extended survival compared with patients whose complete remission was induced with chemotherapy alone. The new data show that the median survival of patients treated with Genasense plus chemotherapy who achieved complete remission (CR, defined as complete plus nodular partial response) has still not been reached but currently exceeds 55+ months, compared to a median of 45 months in the chemotherapy-alone group. Of 20 patients in the Genasense group who achieved CR, 12 (60%) remain alive compared with 3 of the 8 patients who achieved CR with chemotherapy alone (38%).  With a minimum follow-up of 54 months, 9 of the 12 CR patients in the Genasense group have not required additional therapy, and 5 (25%) remain in continuous CR.  In the chemotherapy-alone group, all 3 survivors who previously achieved CR have relapsed, and all have required additional anti-leukemic therapy. SOURCE: ASH December 2007Trial achieved its primary endpoint, which was a statistically significant increase in the proportion of patients who achieved a complete or nodular partial response (CR/nPR) (17% vs. 7%; P=0.025). Patients who achieved CR/nPR experienced the disappearance of all predefined CLL symptoms, including fever, night sweats, fatigue, abdominal discomfort due to an enlarged spleen, and impaired mobility due to swollen lymph nodes. The key secondary endpoint - duration of CR/nPR - was also significantly longer for patients treated with Genasense (median = not reached but will exceed 36+ months in the Genasense group vs. 22 months for patients treated with chemotherapy alone). Among patients who achieved a CR/nPR with Genasense, 70 percent were alive at three years versus 38 percent for the control arm. Among patients who achieved a partial response, 45 percent who received Genasense were alive at three years compared to 33 percent for the control arm (SOURCE: JCO FEB 07).@-@@@@COMBO@OBLIMERSEN SODIUM@@@@@OBLIMERSEN SODIUM||||@GENTA@@@@@GENTA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia||||||||@GENASENSE@@@@@GENASENSE||||@Bcl-2 Inhibitor@@@@@Bcl-2 Inhibitor||||@COMPLETE RESPONSE@@@@@@@@@@RELAPSED@REFRACTORY@@@@RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@ACTIVE CONTROL@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@@-@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-@@@INJECTION@US$@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer. Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs (PDGFR, RET, or KIT) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRß- and VEGFR2-dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo.@@15299350@Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor GIST: indicated for the treatment of GIST after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14917432@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@@JANSSEN CILAG||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@DUROGESIC SMAT@@@@@DUROGESIC SMAT||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1807@48@71.67@50.21@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/15/2017@4.8@4.8@575108@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MCG@25 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@RATIOPHARM@@@@@RATIOPHARM||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@260.52@340.36@269.42@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@13.03@13.03@1039458@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@75@MCG@75 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

The inhibition profile of ABT-869 is evident in cellular assays of RTK phosphorylation (IC50 = 2, 4, and 7 nmol/L for PDGFR-ß, KDR, and CSF-1R, respectively) and VEGF-stimulated proliferation (IC50 = 0.2 nmol/L for human endothelial cells). ABT-869 is not a general antiproliferative agent because, in most cancer cells, >1,000-fold higher concentrations of ABT-869 are required for inhibition of proliferation. However, ABT-869 exhibits potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on cancer cells whose proliferation is dependent on mutant kinases, such as FLT3. In vivo ABT-869 is effective orally in the mechanism-based murine models of VEGF-induced uterine edema (ED50 = 0.5 mg/kg) and corneal angiogenesis (>50% inhibition, 15 mg/kg). In tumor growth studies, ABT-869 exhibits efficacy in human fibrosarcoma and breast, colon, and small cell lung carcinoma xenograft models (ED50 = 1.5–5 mg/kg, twice daily) and is also effective (>50% inhibition) in orthotopic breast and glioma models.

After titration to the maximum dose of Mimpara, serum calcium should be periodically monitored; if clinically relevant reductions in serum calcium are not maintained, discontinuation of Mimpara therapy should be considered.@4-Oct@@1/10/2005@@@@In three clinical studies of CKD patients on dialysis, 5% of the patients in both the Sensipar and placebo groups reported a history of seizure disorder at baseline. During the trials, seizures (primarily generalized or tonic-clonic) were observed in 1.4% (9/656) of Sensipar-treated patients and 0.4% (2/470) of placebo-treated patients. 5 of the 9 Sensipar-treated patients had a history of a seizure disorder and two were receiving anti-seizure medication at the time of their seizure. Both placebo-treated patients had a history of seizure disorder and were receiving anti-seizure medication at the time of their seizure. While the basis for the reported difference in seizure rate is not clear, the threshold for seizures is lowered by significant reductions in serum calcium levels. Therefore, serum calcium levels should be closely monitored in patients receiving Sensipar, particularly in patients with a history of a seizure disorder@@No@@@@@III; PARATHYROID CARCINOMA@APPROVED@@@HAUTE AUTORITÉ DE SANTÉ@Baseline mean (SD) serum calcium was 14.7 (1.8) mg/dL.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14920115@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal. Pamidronate disodium therapy in patients with Paget's disease has been effective in reducing serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels by = 50% in at least 50% of patients, and by = 30% in at least 80% of patients. Pamidronate disodium therapy has also been effective in reducing these biochemical markers in patients with Paget's disease who failed to respond, or no longer responded to other treatments.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma.

Therefore, under these circumstances the use of imatinib is recommended only in the context of further clinical study. The data for this study should be collected systematically to allow aggregation and analysis at a national level in order to inform the appraisal review. 1.4 For people in chronic-phase CML who are currently receiving interferon alpha (IFN-a) as first-line treatment, the decision about whether to change to imatinib should be informed by the response of the disease to current treatment and by the tolerance of the person to IFN-a.

Most reactions were of mild-to-moderate grade, but drug was discontinued for drug-related adverse reactions in 2.4% of newly diagnosed patients, 4% of patients in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, 4% in accelerated phase and 5% in blast crisis. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse reactions were edema, nausea and vomiting, muscle cramps, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea and rash. Edema was most frequently periorbital or in lower limbs and was managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or by reducing the dose of Gleevec. The frequency of severe superficial edema was 1.5%-6%. The overall safety profile of pediatric patients treated with Gleevec in 93 children studied was similar to that found in studies with adult patients, except that musculoskeletal pain was less frequent (20.5%) and peripheral edema was not reported. Nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported individual adverse reactions with an incidence similar to that seen in adult patients.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer. Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs (PDGFR, RET, or KIT) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRß- and VEGFR2-dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo.@@14923362@Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor GIST: indicated for the treatment of GIST after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate.

It also possesses marked immunosuppressant properties. The principal site of cyclophosphamide activation is the liver. The chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant activity of cyclophosphamide is thought to be mediated by the cytotoxic intermediates produced by activation by mixed function oxidases in hepatic microsomes. Non-enzymatic cleavage, possibly taking place in the tumour cells, results in the formulation of highly cytotoxic forms of the drug.@@14916988@Although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to Cytoxan treatment: 1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma. 2. Multiple myeloma. 3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (Cytoxan given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration). 4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). 5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). 6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 7. Retinoblastoma. 8. Carcinoma of the breast. Cytoxan is also used in non-malignant disease: it is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid therapy or in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, Cytoxan may induce a remission. Cytoxan is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of Cytoxan for patients with no hematologic deficiency usually consists of 40 to 50 mg/kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens include 10 to 15 mg/kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 to 5 mg/kg twice weekly. Many other regimens of intravenous and oral Cytoxan have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia. When Cytoxan is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose as well as that of the other drugs. Cytoxan and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of Cytoxan metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.@FDA, 16 November 1959@11/16/1959@@@@@Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoproliferative malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically. Urinary System: Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal. Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Cardiac Toxicity: Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium. No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Infections: Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE||||@BMS@@@@@BMS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@Breast Cancer@Ovarian Cancer@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia|Breast Cancer|Ovarian Cancer||||||@CYTOXAN@@@@@CYTOXAN||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@1@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@00015-0505-41@POWDER FOR INJECTION FOR RECONSTITUTION@US$@@@@@@@@1@G@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14918224@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@7-Feb@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Sigma acquires Arrow.

In post-menopausal women, oestrogens are produced primarily from the conversion of androgens into oestrogens through the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Oestrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for hormone dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, Aromasin p.o. significantly lowered serum oestrogen concentrations starting from a 5 mg dose, reaching maximal suppression (>90%) with a dose of 10-25 mg. In postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with the 25 mg daily dose, whole body aromatization was reduced by 98%. Exemestane does not possess any progestogenic or oestrogenic activity. A slight androgenic activity, probably due to the 17-hydro derivative, has been observed mainly at high doses. In multiple daily doses trials, Aromasin had no detectable effects on adrenal biosynthesis of cortisol or aldosterone, measured before or after ACTH challenge, thus demonstrating its selectivity with regard to the other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway. Glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid replacements are therefore not needed. A non dose-dependent slight increase in serum LH and FSH levels has been observed even at low doses: this effect is, however, expected for the pharmacological class and is probably the result of feedback at the pituitary level due to the reduction in oestrogen levels that stimulate the pituitary secretion of gonadotropins also in postmenopausal women.@@14918026@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogenreceptor positive early breast cancer who have received two to three years of tamoxifen and are switched to Aromasin for completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy; the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@Co-pay tier 2.

High-titer antibodies were associated with low asparaginase activity in the native arm, but not in the pegaspargase arm. Adverse events, infections, and hospitalization were similar between arms. Event-free survival at 3 years was 82%. A population pharmacodynamic model using the nonlinear mixed effects model (NONMEM) program was developed that closely fit the measured enzyme activity and asparagine concentrations.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14920109@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal. Pamidronate disodium therapy in patients with Paget's disease has been effective in reducing serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels by = 50% in at least 50% of patients, and by = 30% in at least 80% of patients. Pamidronate disodium therapy has also been effective in reducing these biochemical markers in patients with Paget's disease who failed to respond, or no longer responded to other treatments. Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer and Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma: Pamidronate disodium is indicated, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy, for the treatment of osteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer and osteolytic lesions of multiple myeloma.

Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia may be severe enough to cause death. Possible bone marrow depression requires careful monitoring of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelet levels. Such toxicity may necessitate temporary suspension or cessation of therapy. Hepatic toxicity, accompanied by hepatic vein thrombosis and hepatocellular necrosis resulting in death, have been reported. The incidence of such reactions has been low. This toxicity has been observed mostly when dacarbazine has been administered concomitantly with other anti-neoplastic drugs; however, it has also been reported in some patients treated with dacarbazine alone. Therefore frequent monitoring of liver size, function and blood counts (especially eosinophils) is required. It is recommended that dacarbazine be administered by physicians experienced in the use of cytotoxic therapy. Laboratory facilities should be available for blood monitoring.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919232@Indicated for the management of nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and for the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV).@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@100%@@@@@Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated With Highly Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy: The recommended adult oral dosage is 24 mg given as three 8-mg tablets administered 30 minutes before the start of single-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2.

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14918218@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Acquired via the takeover of generics unit of Merck KGaA@@@@Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated With Highly Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy: The recommended adult oral dosage is 24 mg given as three 8-mg tablets administered 30 minutes before the start of single-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2.

Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects. The differences in potencies for carboplatin and cisplatin appear to be directly related to the difference in aquation rates.@@14920006@It is indicated for the initial treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma in established combination with other approved chemotherapeutics such as Paraplatin and cyclophosphamide.

In combination with cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2 IV on day 1 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles) for previously untreated patients, 300mg/m2 IV on day every 4 weeks for 6 cycles should be used. Suggested dose adjustments include 125% from prior course if platelet and neutrophil counts are above 100,000 and 2,000 respectively; no adjustment if the counts are 50-100,000 or 500-2,000 respectively; and 75% if they are under 50,000 and 500 respectively.@@@@@@@Bone marrow suppression (leukopaenia, neutropaenia, and thrombocytopaenia) is dose-dependent and is also the dose-limiting toxicity. Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents. It can induce emesis, which can be more severe in patients previously receiving emetogenic therapy.

Most clinical experience has been with mitoxantrone combined with cytarabine. This combination has been used successfully for primary treatment of ANLL as well as in the treatment of relapse. An effective regimen for induction in previously untreated patients has been mitoxantrone 10-12 mg/m2 IV for 3 days combined with cytarabine 100 mg/m2 IV for 7 days (by continuous infusion). This is followed by second induction and consolidation courses as thought appropriate by the treating clinician. In clinical studies, duration of therapy in induction and consolidation courses with mitoxantrone have been reduced to 2 days, and that of cytarabine to 5 days. However, modification to the above regimen should be carried out by the treating clinician depending on individual patient factors.@@@@@@@There may be an increased risk of leukaemia when mitoxantrone is used as adjuvant treatment of non-metastatic breast cancer.

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor.

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14918202@Methotrexate is used in the treatment of adults with severe, active, classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis who are unresponsive or intolerant to conventional therapy. Methotrexate has also been used in the treatment of severe, uncontrolled psoriasis, which is not responsive to other therapy. Methotrexate has been used to produce regression in a wide range of neoplastic conditions including acute leukaemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue and osteogenic sarcomas, and solid tumours particularly breast, lung, head and neck, bladder, cervical, ovarian, and testicular carcinoma.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Acquired via takeover of generics unit of Merck KGaA@@@@Dosage for cancer treatment: A test dose of 5 - 10 mg parenterally is recommended, one week prior to therapy to detect idiosyncratic adverse events.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short.

The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@MIBE@@@@@MIBE||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@FENTADOLON@@@@@FENTADOLON||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@169.56@225.36@175.6@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@8.48@8.48@1914498@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@50@MCG@MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

When bound to the polymer, paclitaxel is rendered inactive, potentially sparing normal tissue's exposure to high levels of the active drug and its associated toxicities. Blood vessels in tumor tissue, unlike blood vessels in normal tissue, are porous to molecules like polyglutamate. Based on preclinical studies, it appears that Opaxio is preferentially distributed to tumors due to their leaky blood vessels and trapped in the tumor bed allowing significantly more of the dose of chemotherapy to localize in the tumor than with standard paclitaxel. Once inside the tumor cell, enzymes metabolize the protein polymer, releasing the paclitaxel chemotherapy. Preclinical and clinical studies support that Opaxio metabolism by lung cancer cells may be influenced by estrogen, which could lead to enhanced release of paclitaxel and efficacy in women with lung cancer compared to standard therapies. This is being studied in an ongoing phase III trial.@@14922735@Stage III NSCLC@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@October 2006; Novartis licensed exclusive worldwide development and commercialisation rjghts of Xyotax for up to US$270 million.

[Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Leukemia: When used for induction, methotrexate in doses of 3.3 mg/m2 in combination with 60 mg/m2 of prednisone, given daily, produced remissions in 50% of patients treated, usually within a period of 4 to 6 weeks. Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia||||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1.1511@11.04@24.94@12.09@@@@@@@@@@0.22@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@11.04@11.04@4507440@SOLUTION FOR INJECTION (2 ML)@EURO@@@@@@@@50@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany

Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate. Combined use of methotrexate with gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or cytotoxic agents, has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects. Rest and physiotherapy as indicated should be continued.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@N/A@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@DAVA PHARMACEUTICALS@@@@@DAVA PHARMACEUTICALS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@RHEUMATREX@@@@@RHEUMATREX||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@20@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@67253-0580-45@TABLET@US$@@@@@@@@2.5@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States

The binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some but not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance gene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental antitumour activity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours.@@14923740@Breast Cancer: Taxotere is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy.

If intolerance develops, the dose should be lowered to 1.5 million IU three times per week.@1-Nov-99@11/1/1999@10/14/2000@@@@Roferon-A should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the management of the respective indication. Appropriate management of the therapy and its complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. Patients should be informed not only of the benefits of therapy but also that they will probably experience adverse reactions. Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately. Psychiatric intervention and/or drug discontinuation should be considered in such cases. Ophthalmologic: As with other interferons, retinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis and optic neuropathy which may result in loss of vision, have been reported after treatment with Roferon-A. Any patient complaining of decrease or loss of vision must have an eye examination. Because these ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual examination prior to initiation of Roferon-A monotherapy or in the combination therapy with ribavirin is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
