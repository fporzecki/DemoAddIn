Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919579@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@1 A PHARMA@@@@@1 A PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@89.78@124.5@93.31@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@8.98@8.98@683447@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@50@MCG@50 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Hollis-Eden believes that Apoptone may be directly inducing apoptosis, or cell death, in tumor cells, as opposed to traditional hormone blockade therapies directed at simply interrupting either the synthesis or the signaling of the tumor cell growth through the androgen or estrogen receptor. While hormone blockade therapy can effectively control prostate cancer for a period of time, it will eventually fail and the cancer can continue to grow and spread. Analysis of gene expression from tumor cells in preclinical studies conducted to date indicate Apoptone appears to act as an apoptotic agent, down-regulating genes that protect tumor cells from apoptosis, such as Bcl-2, while increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic genes such as caspases.@@14921170@Advanced prostate cancer who have failed hormone therapy and at least one taxane based chemotherapy regimen.@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@NCT00716794@44@-@-@@@-@@7/1/2008@-@HE3235-0201@@-@-@@@I/II@II@@-@-@Trial started.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer. Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs (PDGFR, RET, or KIT) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRß- and VEGFR2-dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo.@@14923363@Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor GIST: indicated for the treatment of GIST after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate.

Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately. Psychiatric intervention and/or drug discontinuation should be considered in such cases. Ophthalmologic: As with other interferons, retinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis and optic neuropathy which may result in loss of vision, have been reported after treatment with Roferon-A.

In post-menopausal women, oestrogens are produced primarily from the conversion of androgens into oestrogens through the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Oestrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for hormone dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, Aromasin p.o. significantly lowered serum oestrogen concentrations starting from a 5 mg dose, reaching maximal suppression (>90%) with a dose of 10-25 mg. In postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with the 25 mg daily dose, whole body aromatization was reduced by 98%. Exemestane does not possess any progestogenic or oestrogenic activity. A slight androgenic activity, probably due to the 17-hydro derivative, has been observed mainly at high doses. In multiple daily doses trials, Aromasin had no detectable effects on adrenal biosynthesis of cortisol or aldosterone, measured before or after ACTH challenge, thus demonstrating its selectivity with regard to the other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway. Glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid replacements are therefore not needed. A non dose-dependent slight increase in serum LH and FSH levels has been observed even at low doses: this effect is, however, expected for the pharmacological class and is probably the result of feedback at the pituitary level due to the reduction in oestrogen levels that stimulate the pituitary secretion of gonadotropins also in postmenopausal women.@@14916967@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogenreceptor positive early breast cancer who have received two to three years of tamoxifen and are switched to Aromasin for completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy; the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy.@@-@-@@NICE: for unplanned swtich therapy 45% likely to be £20,000 per QALY and 80% to be £30,000@@@@100%@-@SECOND-LINE@-@4724@The recommended dose of Aromasin in early and advanced breast cancer is one 25 mg tablet once daily after a meal.

[Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@7.28@20.19@8.21@@@@@@@@@@0.07@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@0.73@0.73@3159468@TABLET@EURO@@@@@@@@10@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918388@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@AWD PHARMA@@@@@AWD PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@241.43@316.23@249.74@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@12.07@12.07@822877@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

In post-menopausal women, oestrogens are produced primarily from the conversion of androgens into oestrogens through the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Oestrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for hormone dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, Aromasin p.o. significantly lowered serum oestrogen concentrations starting from a 5 mg dose, reaching maximal suppression (>90%) with a dose of 10-25 mg. In postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with the 25 mg daily dose, whole body aromatization was reduced by 98%. Exemestane does not possess any progestogenic or oestrogenic activity. A slight androgenic activity, probably due to the 17-hydro derivative, has been observed mainly at high doses. In multiple daily doses trials, Aromasin had no detectable effects on adrenal biosynthesis of cortisol or aldosterone, measured before or after ACTH challenge, thus demonstrating its selectivity with regard to the other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway. Glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid replacements are therefore not needed. A non dose-dependent slight increase in serum LH and FSH levels has been observed even at low doses: this effect is, however, expected for the pharmacological class and is probably the result of feedback at the pituitary level due to the reduction in oestrogen levels that stimulate the pituitary secretion of gonadotropins also in postmenopausal women.@@14916973@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogenreceptor positive early breast cancer who have received two to three years of tamoxifen and are switched to Aromasin for completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy; the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy.@@NO@@@@@@@100%@@SECOND-LINE@@4724@The recommended dose of Aromasin in early and advanced breast cancer is one 25 mg tablet once daily after a meal.

NICE has looked at the evidence that is available and decided that at the moment it can't recommend routine use of vinorelbine together with other chemotherapy drugs (combination therapy).@NHS@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@BOTH@VINORELBINE TARTRATE@CISPLATIN@@@@VINORELBINE TARTRATE|CISPLATIN|||@PIERRE FABRE@@@@@PIERRE FABRE||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Breast Cancer@@@@@Breast Cancer|||||||||@NAVELBINE@@@@@NAVELBINE||||@Plant Alkaloid@Vinca Alkaloids@@@@Plant Alkaloid|Vinca Alkaloids|||@@@@@@@@@@@ADVANCED@REFRACTORY@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@1@year@1 year@23558.66@23558.66@64.54@1@1.299@43.98@@@@@@@@@@@@2.2@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@7/28/2017@43.98@43.98@9.52E+15@CAPSULES@GB£@@@@@@@@20@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@243@United Kingdom@@@@@@@@

Daily blood counts should be taken. Almost all patients can be carried to toxicity with these doses. Alternatively, 0.5 to 1 mg/kg may be infused daily in 1-24 hours for ten days, and then at a rate of 2 mg/kg/day until toxicity is observed. Continue to toxicity or until remission occurs. Results from one hour infusions have been satisfactory in the majority of patients. Intermittent dosing: Cytarabine may be given as intermittent intravenous doses of 3-5 mg/kg daily, for five consecutive days. This course of treatment can be repeated after an interval of 2 to 9 days, and repeated until the therapeutic response or toxicity is exhibited. Evidence of bone marrow improvement has been reported to occur 7-64 days days after the beginning of therapy. In general, if a patient shows neither remission or toxicity after a trial period, then cautiously administered higher doses can be administered. Generally patients tolerate higher doses given by rapid intravenous injection rather than slow infusion.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919477@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy.

14917598@Onco@@@@@300f1018ntsdm@@@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@L01AA01@L01A@NO@NEW YORK, NEW YORK@@@Cyclophosphamide is an antineoplastic agent which is converted in the body to an active alkylating metabolite. It also possesses marked immunosuppressant properties. The principal site of cyclophosphamide activation is the liver. The chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant activity of cyclophosphamide is thought to be mediated by the cytotoxic intermediates produced by activation by mixed function oxidases in hepatic microsomes. Non-enzymatic cleavage, possibly taking place in the tumour cells, results in the formulation of highly cytotoxic forms of the drug.@@14917598@Although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to Cytoxan treatment: 1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma. 2. Multiple myeloma. 3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (Cytoxan given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration). 4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). 5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). 6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 7. Retinoblastoma. 8. Carcinoma of the breast. Cytoxan is also used in non-malignant disease: it is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid therapy or in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, Cytoxan may induce a remission. Cytoxan is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.@@YES@@@@@@@@@@@@When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of Cytoxan for patients with no hematologic deficiency usually consists of 40 to 50 mg/kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens include 10 to 15 mg/kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 to 5 mg/kg twice weekly. Many other regimens of intravenous and oral Cytoxan have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia. When Cytoxan is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose as well as that of the other drugs. Cytoxan and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of Cytoxan metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.@TGA, 1 November 1959@11/1/1959@@@@@Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoproliferative malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically. Urinary System: Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal. Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Cardiac Toxicity: Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium. No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Infections: Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@PBS@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE||||@BMS@@@@@BMS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@Breast Cancer@Ovarian Cancer@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia|Breast Cancer|Ovarian Cancer||||||@ENDOXAN@@@@@ENDOXAN||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@562.68@562.68@@1@0.7915@18.27@@@@@@@@@@@@0.04@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@9/1/2017@18.27@18.27@1312-0845-IN-BX@POWDER FOR INJECTION (SOLVENT REQUIRED)@A$@@@@@@@@500@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@23@Australia@@@@@@@@

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919474@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

In postmenopausal women, oestrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens - primarily androstenedione and testosterone - to oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2). The suppression of oestrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Letrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the haem of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of oestrogen biosynthesis in all tissues.@@14917857@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive invasive early breast cancer.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14916639@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses. Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: indicated in the management of selected adults with severe, active, rheumatoid arthritis (ARC criteria), or children with active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate. Combined use of methotrexate with gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or cytotoxic agents, has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects. Rest and physiotherapy as indicated should be continued.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Leukemia: When used for induction, methotrexate in doses of 3.3 mg/m2 in combination with 60 mg/m2 of prednisone, given daily, produced remissions in 50% of patients treated, usually within a period of 4 to 6 weeks. Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@1@RAMQ@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HOSPIRA@@@@@HOSPIRA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia||||||||@APO-METHOTREXATE@@@@@APO-METHOTREXATE||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@100@0.7934@63.25@@@@@@@@@@@@0.25@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/18/2017@0.63@0.63@2182963100@TABLET@C$@@@@@@@@2.5@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@49@Canada@@@@@@@@

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922529@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

In vitro, dasatinib was active in leukemic cell lines representing variants of imatinib mesylate sensitive and resistant disease. Dasatinib inhibited the growth of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines overexpressing BCR-ABL. Under the conditions of the assays, dasatinib was able to overcome imatinib resistance resulting from BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, activation of alternate signaling pathways involving the SRC family kinases (LYN, HCK), and multi-drug resistance gene overexpression.@@15361188@Indicated in the treatment of adults patients with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and lymphoid blast CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.@@NO@14-Mar-07@3/14/2007@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@78@The recommended starting dosage for accelerated, myeloid or lymphoid blast phase (advanced phase) CML or Ph+ALL is 70 mg twice daily administered orally, one tablet in the morning and one in the evening.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918431@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@RATIOPHARM@@@@@RATIOPHARM||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@12.76@27.12@13.86@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@2.55@2.55@2512276@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@12@MCG@12 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered.

Like other glucocorticoids, dexamethasone also has anti-allergic, antipyretic and immunosuppressive properties. Dexamethasone has practically no water and salt-retaining properties and is, therefore, particularly suitable for the use in patients with cardiac failure or hypertension. Because of its long biological half-life (36-54 hours), dexamethasone is especially suitable in conditions where continuous glucocorticoid action is desired.@@14919375@Allergic states: Control of severe or incapacitating allergic conditions intractable to adequate trials of conventional treatment in asthma, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, drug hypersensitivity reactions, perennial or seasonal allergic rhinitis, and serum sickness.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14921149@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@NYCOMED@@@@@NYCOMED||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@MATRIFEN@@@@@MATRIFEN||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@4@1.1511@9.82@23.4@10.83@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@2.46@2.46@7331013@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@12@MCG@12 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

Roferon-A should be given alone mainly in case of intolerance or contra-indication to ribavirin; Follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Advanced renal cell carcinoma; Patients with AJCC Stage II malignant melanoma (Breslow tumour thickness> 1.5mm, no lymph node involvement or cutaneous spread) who are free of disease after surgery.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@100%@@@@@AIDS-RELATED KAPOSI'S SARCOMA - Initial dosage: Roferon-A should be given by subcutaneous injection, and escalated to at least 18 million IU daily and if possible to 36 million IU daily for a total of ten to twelve weeks in patients of 18 years or older. The recommended escalation schedule is as follows: Days 1 – 3 3 million IU daily; Days 4 – 6 9 million IU daily; Days 7 – 9 18 million IU daily and, if tolerated, increase to: Days 10 – 84 36 million IU daily. Maintenance dosage: Roferon-A should be given by subcutaneous injection three times per week at the maximum dose which is acceptable to the patient, but not exceeding 36 million IU. Patients with AIDSrelated Kaposi's sarcoma treated with 3 million IU of Roferon-A given daily showed a lower response rate than those treated with the recommended dosage.@EMA, July 1999@@@@@@Roferon-A should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the management of the respective indication. Appropriate management of the therapy and its complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. Patients should be informed not only of the benefits of therapy but also that they will probably experience adverse reactions. Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately. Psychiatric intervention and/or drug discontinuation should be considered in such cases. Ophthalmologic: As with other interferons, retinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis and optic neuropathy which may result in loss of vision, have been reported after treatment with Roferon-A. Any patient complaining of decrease or loss of vision must have an eye examination. Because these ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual examination prior to initiation of Roferon-A monotherapy or in the combination therapy with ribavirin is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Roferon-A monotherapy or the combination therapy with ribavirin should be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmologic disorders.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@NHS@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@INTERFERON ALPHA-2A@@@@@INTERFERON ALPHA-2A||||@ROCHE@@@@@ROCHE||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Kaposi's Sarcoma@Melanoma / Skin Cancer@Kidney Cancer@@@Kaposi's Sarcoma|Melanoma / Skin Cancer|Kidney Cancer|||||||@ROFERON A@@@@@ROFERON A||||@Immunotherapy@Interferon@@@@Immunotherapy|Interferon|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1.299@42.57@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@7/28/2017@42.57@42.57@4.22E+15@INJECTION  0,5 ML PREFILLED SYR.@GB£@@@@@@@@9@MU@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@243@United Kingdom@@@@@@@@
14918096@Onco@@@@@300f1014ntsdm@@@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@L01BA01@L01B@YES@MADISON, NEW JERSEY@@@Methotrexate is an antimetabolite which acts principally by competitively inhibiting the enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase. In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14918096@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses. Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: indicated in the management of selected adults with severe, active, rheumatoid arthritis (ARC criteria), or children with active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate. Combined use of methotrexate with gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or cytotoxic agents, has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects. Rest and physiotherapy as indicated should be continued.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@-@@@@@@Leukemia: When used for induction, methotrexate in doses of 3.3 mg/m2 in combination with 60 mg/m2 of prednisone, given daily, produced remissions in 50% of patients treated, usually within a period of 4 to 6 weeks. Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@1@RAMQ@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HOSPIRA@@@@@HOSPIRA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@0.7881@8.92@@@@@@@@@@@@0.18@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@7/19/2017@8.92@8.92@21827772@INJECTION, 2 ML@C$@@@@@@@@50@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@49@Canada@@@@@@@@

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro.

The suppression of oestrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme.

Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922528@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

Both GnRH agonists and blockers bind to this same receptor target. Agonists work initially by stimulating release of LH and hence testosterone production, but blockers, like degarelix, directly prevent the release of LH, which means there is no surge in testosterone at the start of treatment leading to characteristic flare responses in symptoms and tumour growth.

Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose.

Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14920106@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal. Pamidronate disodium therapy in patients with Paget's disease has been effective in reducing serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels by = 50% in at least 50% of patients, and by = 30% in at least 80% of patients. Pamidronate disodium therapy has also been effective in reducing these biochemical markers in patients with Paget's disease who failed to respond, or no longer responded to other treatments. Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer and Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma: Pamidronate disodium is indicated, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy, for the treatment of osteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer and osteolytic lesions of multiple myeloma. The pamidronate disodium treatment effect appeared to be smaller in the study of breast cancer patients receiving hormonal therapy than in the study of those receiving chemotherapy, however, overall evidence of clinical benefit has been demonstrated.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Acquired through takeover of Mayne Pharma, which acquired it from Faulding@@@392@The recommended dose of pamidronate disodium in patients with osteolytic bone lesions of multiple myeloma is 90 mg administered as a 4-hour infusion given on a monthly basis.

CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919897@1.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14916906@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@YES@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@392@Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia; please see label for dosing ranges; the total dose of pamidronate disodium may be administered either in a single infusion or in multiple infusions over 2-4 consecutive days.

Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@WYETH@PFIZER@@@@WYETH|PFIZER|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@METHOTREXAT LEDERLE@@@@@METHOTREXAT LEDERLE||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@144.74@193.98@150@@@@@@@@@@0.29@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@14.47@14.47@3362608@SOLUTION FOR INJECTION (2 ML)@EURO@@@@@@@@50@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

This metabolite is believed to be responsible for the reduction of the cumulative renal toxicity of cisplatin and for the reduction of the toxic effects of radiation on normal oral tissues. The ability of Ethyol to differentially protect normal tissues is attributed to the higher capillary alkaline phosphatase activity, higher pH and better vascularity of normal tissues relative to tumor tissue, which results in a more rapid generation of the active thiol metabolite as well as a higher rate constant for uptake into cells. The higher concentration of the thiol metabolite in normal tissues is available to bind to, and thereby detoxify, reactive metabolites of cisplatin.

Methotrexate has been used to produce regression in a wide range of neoplastic conditions including acute leukaemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue and osteogenic sarcomas, and solid tumours particularly breast, lung, head and neck, bladder, cervical, ovarian, and testicular carcinoma.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Acquired via takeover of generics unit of Merck KGaA@@@@Dosage for cancer treatment: A test dose of 5 - 10 mg parenterally is recommended, one week prior to therapy to detect idiosyncratic adverse events. Single doses, not exceeding 30 mg/m2, on not more than 5 consecutive days. A rest period of at least two weeks is recommended between treatments, in order to allow the bone marrow to return to normal. Doses in excess of 100 mg are usually given parenterally, when the injectable preparation should be used. Doses in excess of 70 mg/m2 should not be administered without leucovorin rescue (folinic acid rescue) or assay of serum methotrexate levels 24 - 48 hours after dosing. If methotrexate is administered in combination chemotherapy regimens, the dosage should be reduced, taking into consideration any overlapping toxicity of the other drug components.@@@@@@@Methotrexate should be used with extreme caution in patients with haematological depression, renal impairment, diarrhoea, ulcerative disorders of the GI tract and psychiatric disorders. Hepatic toxicity has been observed, usually associated with chronic hepatic disease. Renal lesions may develop if the urinary flow is impeded and urinary pH is low, especially if large doses have been administered. The administration of low doses of methotrexate for prolonged periods may give rise, in particular, to hepatic toxicity.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922178@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Novartis purchases Hexal and Eon Labs in a 5.65 billion euro deal.

Overall EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) considered that Lenvima has a safety profile which is consistent with other similar therapies and that side effects were predictable and manageable. However, the CHMP has requested a further study to investigate the most appropriate starting dose of Lenvima to optimise the benefits and reduce risks for patients who will be treated with the medicine.The opinion adopted by the CHMP at its March 2015 meeting is an intermediary step on Lenvima's path to patient access. The CHMP opinion will now be sent to the European Commission for the adoption of a decision on EU-wide marketing authorisation. Once a marketing authorisation has been granted, a decision about price and reimbursement will then take place at the level of each Member State considering the potential role/use of this medicine in the context of the national health system of that country.[EMA, http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2015/03/news_detail_002297.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1]@@@@@MONO@LENVATINIB@@@@@LENVATINIB||||@EISAI@@@@@EISAI||||@United States@Australia@Belgium@Brazil@Canada@United States|Australia|Belgium|Brazil|Canada|Chile|Denmark|France|Germany|Japan@Thyroid Cancer@@@@@Thyroid Cancer|||||||||@LENVIMA@@@@@LENVIMA||||@TK Inhibitor@@@@@TK Inhibitor||||@PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL@@@@@OVERALL RESPONSE RATE@@@@@REFRACTORY@DIFFERENTIATED@@@@RANDOMIZED@DOUBLE BLIND@PLACEBO-CONTROLLED@MULTICENTER@@1@1@78371.08113@62780@@18.3@month@18.3 month@78371.08@78371.08@140.8@30@1.1511@1760@2214.55@1798.5@@@@@@@@@@5.87@1@@mg@24@1@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@58.67@58.67@11010728@HARD CAPSULE@EURO@@@@@@@@10@MG@10 MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

The recommended starting dose for Aranesp administered once-every-3-weeks (Q3W) is 500 mcg as a SC injection. For both dosing schedules, the dose should be adjusted for each patient to maintain the lowest haemoglobin level sufficient to avoid the need for RBC transfusion and not to exceed the upper safety limit of 12 g/dL. If the rate of haemoglobin increase is more than 1 g/dL per 2-week period or when the haemoglobin reaches a level needed to avoid transfusion, the dose should be reduced by 40% of the previous dose. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dL, Aranesp should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin approaches a level where transfusions may be required. At this point, therapy should be reinitiated at a dose 40% below the previous dose. For patients receiving weekly administration, if there is less than a 1 g/dL increase in haemoglobin after 6 weeks of therapy, the dose of Aranesp should be increased up to 4.5 mcg/kg.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@WINTHROP@SANOFI-AVENTIS@@@@WINTHROP|SANOFI-AVENTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@44.62@67.4@46.73@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@8.92@8.92@3980186@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@50@MCG@50 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918379@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@AWD PHARMA@@@@@AWD PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@60.12@87@62.72@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@12.02@12.02@822452@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation.

Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@N/A@@@-@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@-@-@@@-@APPROVED@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@-@@@@-@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@WYETH@PFIZER@@@@WYETH|PFIZER|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@-@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@-@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1.1229@760.12@1254.5@794.33@@@@@@@@@@2.53@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@6/7/2017@760.12@760.12@37112036@CONCENTRATE FOR SOLUTION FOR INFUSION (VIAL), 50 ML@EURO@@@@@@@@300@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@119@Italy@@@@@@@@

When bound to the polymer, paclitaxel is rendered inactive, potentially sparing normal tissue's exposure to high levels of the active drug and its associated toxicities. Blood vessels in tumor tissue, unlike blood vessels in normal tissue, are porous to molecules like polyglutamate. Based on preclinical studies, it appears that Opaxio is preferentially distributed to tumors due to their leaky blood vessels and trapped in the tumor bed allowing significantly more of the dose of chemotherapy to localize in the tumor than with standard paclitaxel. Once inside the tumor cell, enzymes metabolize the protein polymer, releasing the paclitaxel chemotherapy. Preclinical and clinical studies support that Opaxio metabolism by lung cancer cells may be influenced by estrogen, which could lead to enhanced release of paclitaxel and efficacy in women with lung cancer compared to standard therapies.

14917319@Onco@@@@@300f1014ntsdm@300f1813ntsdm@@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@NO@NEW YORK, NEW YORK@@@Cyclophosphamide is an antineoplastic agent which is converted in the body to an active alkylating metabolite. It also possesses marked immunosuppressant properties. The principal site of cyclophosphamide activation is the liver. The chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant activity of cyclophosphamide is thought to be mediated by the cytotoxic intermediates produced by activation by mixed function oxidases in hepatic microsomes. Non-enzymatic cleavage, possibly taking place in the tumour cells, results in the formulation of highly cytotoxic forms of the drug.@@14917319@Although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to Cytoxan treatment: 1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma. 2. Multiple myeloma. 3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (Cytoxan given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration). 4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). 5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). 6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 7. Retinoblastoma. 8. Carcinoma of the breast. Cytoxan is also used in non-malignant disease: it is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid therapy or in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, Cytoxan may induce a remission. Cytoxan is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.@@@@@@@@-@@@@@@When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of Cytoxan for patients with no hematologic deficiency usually consists of 40 to 50 mg/kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens include 10 to 15 mg/kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 to 5 mg/kg twice weekly. Many other regimens of intravenous and oral Cytoxan have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia. When Cytoxan is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose as well as that of the other drugs. Cytoxan and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of Cytoxan metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.@1-Nov-59@11/1/1959@@@@@Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoproliferative malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically. Urinary System: Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal. Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Cardiac Toxicity: Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium. No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Infections: Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@RAMQ@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE||||@BMS@@@@@BMS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@Breast Cancer@Ovarian Cancer@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia|Breast Cancer|Ovarian Cancer||||||@CYTOXAN@@@@@CYTOXAN||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@100@0.7934@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@INJECTION@C$@@@@@@@@50@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@49@Canada@@@@@@@@

VEGF and PDGF are growth factors critical to the development and growth of blood vessels - a process known as angiogenesis. Angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in the growth and spread of several tumour types, with VEGF and PDGF overexpression linked to multiple cancers including cancers of the liver, lung, breast, kidney, bladder, ovaries, and colon. By inhibiting VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-kit pazopanib may stop or slow the rate of tumour growth and development. Pazopanib is currently being studied in a number of different tumour types; clinical trials are currently underway in renal cell carcinoma (Phase III), breast cancer (Phase III in inflammatory breast cancer), ovarian cancer, STS, NSCLC, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.

In post-menopausal women, oestrogens are produced primarily from the conversion of androgens into oestrogens through the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Oestrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for hormone dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, Aromasin p.o. significantly lowered serum oestrogen concentrations starting from a 5 mg dose, reaching maximal suppression (>90%) with a dose of 10-25 mg. In postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with the 25 mg daily dose, whole body aromatization was reduced by 98%. Exemestane does not possess any progestogenic or oestrogenic activity. A slight androgenic activity, probably due to the 17-hydro derivative, has been observed mainly at high doses. In multiple daily doses trials, Aromasin had no detectable effects on adrenal biosynthesis of cortisol or aldosterone, measured before or after ACTH challenge, thus demonstrating its selectivity with regard to the other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway. Glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid replacements are therefore not needed. A non dose-dependent slight increase in serum LH and FSH levels has been observed even at low doses: this effect is, however, expected for the pharmacological class and is probably the result of feedback at the pituitary level due to the reduction in oestrogen levels that stimulate the pituitary secretion of gonadotropins also in postmenopausal women.@@14916957@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogenreceptor positive early breast cancer who have received two to three years of tamoxifen and are switched to Aromasin for completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy; the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy.@@NO@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@100%@-@SECOND-LINE@-@769@The recommended dose of Aromasin in early and advanced breast cancer is one 25 mg tablet once daily after a meal.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@N/A@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@DAVA PHARMACEUTICALS@@@@@DAVA PHARMACEUTICALS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@RHEUMATREX@@@@@RHEUMATREX||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@24@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@67253-0580-46@TABLET@US$@@@@@@@@2.5@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919573@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919616@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@357@Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated With Highly Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy: The recommended adult oral dosage is 24 mg given as three 8-mg tablets administered 30 minutes before the start of single-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2.

Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately. Psychiatric intervention and/or drug discontinuation should be considered in such cases. Ophthalmologic: As with other interferons, retinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis and optic neuropathy which may result in loss of vision, have been reported after treatment with Roferon-A. Any patient complaining of decrease or loss of vision must have an eye examination.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Little or no binding was observed in the non-lymphoid tissues examined.@@16749465@Maintenance therapy is indicated for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients responding to induction therapy@@YES@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Roche announces US$43.7 billion proposal to assume full control of Genentech.

This OS analysis showed a statistically significant advantage for Nexavar over placebo for OS (HR: 0.69, p= 0.00058, see Table 4). In the prespecified stratification factors (ECOG status, presence or absence of macroscopic vascular invasion and/or extrahepatic tumour spread) the hazard ratio consistently favoured Nexavar over placebo. The descriptive subgroup analysis suggested a potentially less pronounced treatment effect for the subgroups of patients below 65 years of age and those with metastatic disease. There are limited data from this study in patients with Child Pugh B liver impairment and only one patient with Child Pugh C had been included.@Most common adverse reactions reported for Nexavar-treated patients vs placebo-treated patients in unresectable HCC, respectively, were: diarrhea (55% vs 25%), fatigue (46% vs 45%), abdominal pain (31% vs 26%), weight loss (30% vs 10%), anorexia (29% vs 18%), nausea (24% vs 20%), and hand-foot skin reaction (21% vs 3%).

The effects of perifosine on Akt are of particular interest because of the importance of this pathway in the development of most cancers, the evidence that it is often activated in tumors that are resistant to other forms of anticancer therapy, and the difficulty encountered thus far in the discovery of drugs that will inhibit this pathway without causing excessive toxicity. High levels of activated Akt (pAkt) are seen frequently in many types of cancer and have been correlated with poor prognosis in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma, gastric, hepatocellular, endometrial, prostate, renal cell, head and neck cancers and hematological malignancies, as well as glioblastoma. The majority of tumors expressing high levels of pAkt were high-grade, advanced stage or had other features associated with poor prognosis. High pAkt is often seen in tumors that are resistant to conventional cancer treatments, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and especially therapy with some of the newer biologicals. Published data suggest that the Akt pathway is frequently activated in renal cell cancer and that this tumor type may be particularly responsive to Akt inhibition.@@14916689@Refractory and relapsed leukaemia@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Keryx receives notice from Nasdaq that the company is not in compliance with the US$1 minimum bid price for continued listing and most reach this within 180 days.

In clinical studies with a dosage of 12 mg/m2 daily for 5 days, patients who achieved a complete remission did so as a result of the first induction course. Combination Therapy: Mitoxantrone has been used in combination regimens for the treatment of acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL). Most clinical experience has been with mitoxantrone combined with cytarabine. This combination has been used successfully for primary treatment of ANLL as well as in the treatment of relapse. An effective regimen for induction in previously untreated patients has been mitoxantrone 10-12 mg/m2 IV for 3 days combined with cytarabine 100 mg/m2 IV for 7 days (by continuous infusion). This is followed by second induction and consolidation courses as thought appropriate by the treating clinician. In clinical studies, duration of therapy in induction and consolidation courses with mitoxantrone have been reduced to 2 days, and that of cytarabine to 5 days. However, modification to the above regimen should be carried out by the treating clinician depending on individual patient factors.@N/A@@@-@@@Leukaemia: When used in high doses (over 14mg/m2 per day for 3 days) such as indicated for leukaemia, severe myelosupression will occur.

Idarubicin has been shown to have a higher potency with respect to daunorubicin and to be an effective agent against murine leukaemia and lymphomas both by i.v. and oral routes.

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs.

Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@180.63@239.36@187.02@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@9.03@9.03@4432676@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@50@MCG@50 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs.

A lower initial dosage (12 mg/m2 or less) is recommended for patients with inadequate bone marrow reserves e.g. due to prior chemotherapy or poor general condition. Combination Therapy: Mitoxantrone has been given as part of combination therapy. In metastatic breast cancer, combinations of mitoxantrone with other cytotoxic agents including cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil, or methotrexate and mitomycin C, have been shown to be effective. Reference should be made to the published literature for information on dosage modifications and administration. Mitoxantrone has also been used in various combinations for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, however data are presently limited and specific regimens cannot be recommended. As a guide, when mitoxantrone is used in combination chemotherapy with another myelosuppressive agent, the initial dose of mitoxantrone should be reduced by 2-4 mg/m2 below the doses recommended for single agent use. Subsequent doses, as outlined in the table above, depend on the degree and duration of myelosuppression.@@@@@@@There may be an increased risk of leukaemia when mitoxantrone is used as adjuvant treatment of non-metastatic breast cancer. In the absence of sufficient efficacy data, mitoxantrone must not be used as adjuvant treatment of non-metastatic breast cancer. Mitoxantrone should be used with caution in patients with myelosuppression or poor general condition. Cases of functional cardiac changes, including congestive heart failure and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction have been reported during mitoxantrone therapy. These cardiac events have occurred most commonly in patients who have had prior treatment with anthracyclines, prior mediastinal/thoracic radiotherapy, or in patients with pre-existing heart disease. The concomitant administration of other cardiotoxic drugs may also increase the risk of cardiac toxicity.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919982@A component of adjuvant therapy in patients with evidence of axillary node tumor involvement following resection of primary breast cancer.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@No tiering.

14922770@Onco@@@@@300f1014ntsdm@@@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@L01AA01@L01A@NO@NEW YORK, NEW YORK@@@Cyclophosphamide is an antineoplastic agent which is converted in the body to an active alkylating metabolite. It also possesses marked immunosuppressant properties. The principal site of cyclophosphamide activation is the liver. The chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant activity of cyclophosphamide is thought to be mediated by the cytotoxic intermediates produced by activation by mixed function oxidases in hepatic microsomes. Non-enzymatic cleavage, possibly taking place in the tumour cells, results in the formulation of highly cytotoxic forms of the drug.@@14922770@Although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to Cytoxan treatment: 1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma. 2. Multiple myeloma. 3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (Cytoxan given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration). 4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). 5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). 6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 7. Retinoblastoma. 8. Carcinoma of the breast. Cytoxan is also used in non-malignant disease: it is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid therapy or in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, Cytoxan may induce a remission. Cytoxan is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.@@@@@@@@-@@@@@@When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of Cytoxan for patients with no hematologic deficiency usually consists of 40 to 50 mg/kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens include 10 to 15 mg/kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 to 5 mg/kg twice weekly. Many other regimens of intravenous and oral Cytoxan have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia. When Cytoxan is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose as well as that of the other drugs. Cytoxan and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of Cytoxan metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.@1-Nov-59@11/1/1959@@@@@Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoproliferative malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically. Urinary System: Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal. Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Cardiac Toxicity: Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium. No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Infections: Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@RAMQ@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE||||@BAXTER HEALTHCARE@@@@@BAXTER HEALTHCARE||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia@Acute Myeloid Leukaemia@Hodgkin's Lymphoma@Myeloma@Haematological Malignancy|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia|Acute Myeloid Leukaemia|Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Myeloma|||||@PROCYTOX@@@@@PROCYTOX||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@562.68@562.68@@100@0.7881@47.4@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@7/19/2017@0.47@0.47@2241796100@TABLET@C$@@@@@@@@50@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@49@Canada@@@@@@@@

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918456@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@RIEMSER ARZNEIMITTEL@@@@@RIEMSER ARZNEIMITTEL||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@PATCH, TRANSDERMAL@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms.

A primary growth factor for erythroid development, erythropoietin is produced in the kidney and released into the bloodstream in response to hypoxia. In responding to hypoxia, erythropoietin interacts with progenitor stem cells to increase red blood cell (RBC) production. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is impaired in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), and erythropoietin deficiency is the primary cause of their anemia. Increased hemoglobin levels are not generally observed until 2 to 6 weeks after initiating treatment with Aranesp). In patients with cancer receiving concomitant chemotherapy, the etiology of anemia is multifactorial.@@14916859@Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure, including patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis, and for the treatment of anemia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies where anaemia is due to the effect of concomitantly administered chemotherapy.@@NO@28-May-08@5/28/2008@The manufacturer of darbepoetin alfa submitted an economic evaluation that included two scenarios. In the first, the use of darbepoetin alfa was considered over 25 weeks. The second included a time horizon of almost 3 years coupled with a treatment survival advantage (mean HR = 0.88). The associated ICERs for the two scenarios were approximately £160,000 and £24,000 per additional QALY gained, respectively.  In the base case of the Assessment Group's economic analysis, survival was assumed to be the same for both treatment and control arms (that is, a HR of 1 was used). This produced an ICER of more than £100,000 per additional QALY gained. The results of the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that erythropoietin analogues became more cost effective as the threshold haemoglobin concentration for initiating an erythropoietin analogue was reduced to lower levels, but the ICERs still remained high. The most favourable ICERs were obtained if a baseline haemoglobin concentration of 8 g/100 ml was assumed for all participants. These were in the range of £65,000–£80,000 per additional QALY gained.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922526@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919479@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects. The differences in potencies for carboplatin and cisplatin appear to be directly related to the difference in aquation rates.@@14920032@It is indicated for the initial treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma in established combination with other approved chemotherapeutics such as Paraplatin and cyclophosphamide.

In combination with cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2 IV on day 1 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles) for previously untreated patients, 300mg/m2 IV on day every 4 weeks for 6 cycles should be used. Suggested dose adjustments include 125% from prior course if platelet and neutrophil counts are above 100,000 and 2,000 respectively; no adjustment if the counts are 50-100,000 or 500-2,000 respectively; and 75% if they are under 50,000 and 500 respectively.@@@@@@@Bone marrow suppression (leukopaenia, neutropaenia, and thrombocytopaenia) is dose-dependent and is also the dose-limiting toxicity. Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents. It can induce emesis, which can be more severe in patients previously receiving emetogenic therapy.

The dose-dependent cardiotoxicity observed during anthracycline administration is due to anthracycline-induced iron-dependent free radical oxidative stress on the relatively unprotected cardiac muscle. Dexrazoxane, an analogue of EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid), is hydrolysed in cardiac cells to the ring-opened product ICRF-198. Both dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) and ICRF-198 are capable of chelating metal ions. It is generally thought that they can provide cardioprotection by scavenging metal ions thus preventing the Fe3+-anthracycline complex from redox cycling and forming reactive radicals.@@14924653@Zinecard is indicated for reducing the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy associated with doxorubicin administration in women with metastatic breast cancer who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 and who will continue to receive doxorubicin therapy to maintain tumor control. It is not recommended for use with the initiation of doxorubicin therapy.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@N/A@The recommended dosage ratio of Zinecard:doxorubicin is 10:1 (eg, 500 mg/m2 Zinecard:50 mg/m2 doxorubicin). In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance values < 40 mL/min), the recommended dosage ratio of Zinecard:doxorubicin is 5:1 (eg. 250 mg/m2 Zinecard:50 mg/m2 doxorubicin).@FDA, 26 May 1995@5/26/1995@@@@@Zinecard may add to the myelosuppression caused by chemotherapeutic agents. There is some evidence that the use of dexrazoxane concurrently with the initiation of fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FAC) therapy interferes with the antitumor efficacy of the regimen, and this use is not recommended. In the largest of three breast cancer trials, patients who received dexrazoxane starting with their first cycle of FAC therapy had a lower response rate (48% vs 63%; p=0.007) and shorter time to progression than patients who did not receive dexrazoxane. Therefore, Zinecard should only be used in those patients who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 and are continuing with doxorubicin therapy. Although clinical studies have shown that patients receiving FAC with Zinecard may receive a higher cumulative dose of doxorubicin before experiencing cardiac toxicity than patients receiving FAC without Zinecard the use of Zinecard in patients who have already received a cumulative dose of doxorubicin of 300 mg/m2 without Zinecard, does not eliminate the potential for anthracycline induced cardiac toxicity. Therefore, cardiac function should be carefully monitored. Secondary malignancies (primarily acute myeloid leukemia) have been reported in patients treated chronically with oral razoxane. Razoxane is the racemic mixture, of which dexrazoxane is the S(+)-enantiomer. In these patients, the total cumulative dose of razoxane ranged from 26 to 480 grams and the duration of treatment was from 42 to 319 weeks. One case of T-cell lymphoma, a case of B-cell lymphoma and six to eight cases of cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma have also been reported in patients treated with razoxane.@LABEL@No@DECEMBER 2007; SEPTEMBER 2010 (PREVENTION OF CARDIOTOXICITY)@@@@III@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@The difference in decline from baseline in LVEF was evident beginning with a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m2 and reached statistical significance in patients who received =400 mg/m2 of doxorubicin.

In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922204@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@392@Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia; please see label for dosing ranges; the total dose of pamidronate disodium may be administered either in a single infusion or in multiple infusions over 2-4 consecutive days.

This competitively inhibits DNA polymerase and may also inhibit certain acid kinase enzymes. Primarily the drug acts as a false nucleoside and competes for enzymes involved in the conversion of cytidine nucleotide to deoxycytidine nucleotide and also incorporation into the DNA. Cytarabine has no effect on non proliferating cells nor on proliferating cells unless in the S phase.

Dosage recommendations may be converted from those in terms of bodyweight to those related to surface area by means of nomograms, as presented in Documenta Geigy. 1) Remission induction: a) Continuous treatment: i) Rapid injection  2 mg/kg/day is a judicious starting dose. Administer for 10 days. Obtain daily blood counts. If no antileukaemic effect is noted and there is no apparent toxicity, increase to 4 mg/kg/day and maintain until therapeutic response or toxicity is evident. Almost all patients can be carried to toxicity with these doses. ii) 0.5  1.0 mg/kg/day may be given in an infusion of up to 24 hours duration. Results from onehour infusions have been satisfactory in the majority of patients. After 10 days this initial daily dose may be increased to 2 mg/kg/day subject to toxicity. Continue to toxicity or until remission occurs. b) Intermittent treatment: 3-5 mg/kg/day are administered intravenously on each of five consecutive days. After a two to nineday rest period, a further course is given. Continue until response or toxicity occurs. The first evidence of marrow improvement has been reported to occur 7  64 days (mean 28 days) after the beginning of therapy. In general, if a patient shows neither toxicity nor remission after a fair trial, the cautious administration of higher doses is warranted. As a rule, patients have been seen to tolerate higher doses when given by rapid intravenous injection as compared with slow infusion. This difference is due to the rapid metabolism of Cytarabine and the consequent short duration of action of the high dose. 2) Maintenance therapy: Remissions which have been induced by Cytarabine, or by other drugs, may be maintained by intravenous or subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg once or twice weekly.@Sep-85@@@@@@Only physicians experienced in cancer chemotherapy should use Cytarabine for Injection USP. For induction therapy, patients should be treated in a facility with laboratory and supportive resources sufficient to monitor drug tolerance and protect and maintain a patient compromised by drug toxicity. The main toxic effect of cytarabine is bone marrow suppression with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Less serious toxicity includes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, oral ulceration, and hepatic dysfunction.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

The dose-dependent cardiotoxicity observed during anthracycline administration is due to anthracycline-induced iron-dependent free radical oxidative stress on the relatively unprotected cardiac muscle. Dexrazoxane, an analogue of EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid), is hydrolysed in cardiac cells to the ring-opened product ICRF-198. Both dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) and ICRF-198 are capable of chelating metal ions. It is generally thought that they can provide cardioprotection by scavenging metal ions thus preventing the Fe3+-anthracycline complex from redox cycling and forming reactive radicals.@@14920053@Indicated for reducing the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy associated with doxorubicin administration in women with metastatic breast cancer who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 and who will continue to receive doxorubicin therapy to maintain tumor control.

In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance values < 40 mL/min), the recommended dosage ratio of Zinecard:doxorubicin is 5:1 (eg. 250 mg/m2 Zinecard:50 mg/m2 doxorubicin).@@@@@@@Zinecard may add to the myelosuppression caused by chemotherapeutic agents. There is some evidence that the use of dexrazoxane concurrently with the initiation of fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FAC) therapy interferes with the antitumor efficacy of the regimen, and this use is not recommended. In the largest of three breast cancer trials, patients who received dexrazoxane starting with their first cycle of FAC therapy had a lower response rate (48% vs 63%; p=0.007) and shorter time to progression than patients who did not receive dexrazoxane. Therefore, Zinecard should only be used in those patients who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 and are continuing with doxorubicin therapy. Although clinical studies have shown that patients receiving FAC with Zinecard may receive a higher cumulative dose of doxorubicin before experiencing cardiac toxicity than patients receiving FAC without Zinecard the use of Zinecard in patients who have already received a cumulative dose of doxorubicin of 300 mg/m2 without Zinecard, does not eliminate the potential for anthracycline induced cardiac toxicity. Therefore, cardiac function should be carefully monitored. Secondary malignancies (primarily acute myeloid leukemia) have been reported in patients treated chronically with oral razoxane. Razoxane is the racemic mixture, of which dexrazoxane is the S(+)-enantiomer. In these patients, the total cumulative dose of razoxane ranged from 26 to 480 grams and the duration of treatment was from 42 to 319 weeks.

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or in the elderly.@@@@@@@Males: the use of Zoladex in men at particular risk of developing ureteric obstruction or spinal cord compression should be considered carefully, and the patients monitored closely during the first month of therapy. Consideration should be given to the initial use of an anti-androgen (e.g. cyproterone acetate 300 mg daily for three days before and three weeks after commencement of Zoladex) at the start of LHRH analogue therapy since this has been reported to prevent the possible sequelae of the initial rise in serum testosterone. If spinal cord compression or renal impairment due to ureteric obstruction are present or develop, specific standard treatment of these complications should be instituted. Females: the use of LHRH agonists in women may cause a loss of bone mineral density. Following two years treatment for early breast cancer, the average loss of bone mineral density was 6.2% and 11.5% at the femoral neck and lumbar spine respectively. This loss has been shown to be partially reversible at the one year off treatment follow-up with recovery to 3.4% and 6.4% relative to baseline at the femoral neck and lumbar spine respectively, although this recovery is based on very limited data.@SWOG-8692 [INT-0075]@No@@124 PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH ADVANCED ESTROGEN RECEPTOR POSITIVE OR PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR POSITIVE BREAST CANCER WERE RANDOMISED TO 2 TREATMENT GROUPS: THE FIRST RECAIVED ZOLADEX, THE SECOND HAD OOPHORECTOMY.@@@CLINICAL STUDIES - BREAST CANCER: SWOG-8692 [INT-0075]@APPROVED@@@NHI@The best objective response (CR+PR) for the Zoladex group is 22% versus 12% for the oophorectomy group.

The recommended starting dose for Aranesp administered once-every-3-weeks (Q3W) is 500 mcg as a SC injection. For both dosing schedules, the dose should be adjusted for each patient to maintain the lowest haemoglobin level sufficient to avoid the need for RBC transfusion and not to exceed the upper safety limit of 12 g/dL. If the rate of haemoglobin increase is more than 1 g/dL per 2-week period or when the haemoglobin reaches a level needed to avoid transfusion, the dose should be reduced by 40% of the previous dose. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dL, Aranesp should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin approaches a level where transfusions may be required. At this point, therapy should be reinitiated at a dose 40% below the previous dose. For patients receiving weekly administration, if there is less than a 1 g/dL increase in haemoglobin after 6 weeks of therapy, the dose of Aranesp should be increased up to 4.5 mcg/kg.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

SOURCE: Lilly@@L01BA04@L01B@-@INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA@@@Pemetrexed is an antifolate containing the pyrrolopyrimidine-based nucleus that exerts its antineoplastic activity by disrupting folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumor cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues.

[Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Adult acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia: Single Agent Dosage in Relapse: The recommended dosage for remission induction is 12 mg/m2 of body surface area, given as a single intravenous dose daily for five consecutive days (total of 60 mg/m2). In clinical studies with a dosage of 12 mg/m2 daily for 5 days, patients who achieved a complete remission did so as a result of the first induction course. Combination Therapy: Mitoxantrone has been used in combination regimens for the treatment of acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL). Most clinical experience has been with mitoxantrone combined with cytarabine. This combination has been used successfully for primary treatment of ANLL as well as in the treatment of relapse. An effective regimen for induction in previously untreated patients has been mitoxantrone 10-12 mg/m2 IV for 3 days combined with cytarabine 100 mg/m2 IV for 7 days (by continuous infusion). This is followed by second induction and consolidation courses as thought appropriate by the treating clinician. In clinical studies, duration of therapy in induction and consolidation courses with mitoxantrone have been reduced to 2 days, and that of cytarabine to 5 days. However, modification to the above regimen should be carried out by the treating clinician depending on individual patient factors.@6-Nov-03@11/6/2003@@@@@Leukaemia: When used in high doses (over 14mg/m2 per day for 3 days) such as indicated for leukaemia, severe myelosupression will occur. It should only administered by experienced chemo physicians. Blood and blood products must be available to support patients during the expected period of medullary hypoplasia and severe myelosupression. Particular care should be given to assuring full haemotologic recovery before any consolidation therapy. Acute congestive heart failure may occasionally occur in patients treated with mitoxantrone for ANLL. In firstline comparative trials of mitoxantrone + cytarabine vs. daunorubicin + cytarabine in adult patients with previously untreated ANLL, therapy was associated with congestive heart failure in 6.5% of patients on each arm.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14917876@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@MIBE@@@@@MIBE||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@FENTADOLON@@@@@FENTADOLON||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@84.13@117.35@87.48@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@8.41@8.41@1914481@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@50@MCG@MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922091@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal. Pamidronate disodium therapy in patients with Paget's disease has been effective in reducing serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels by = 50% in at least 50% of patients, and by = 30% in at least 80% of patients. Pamidronate disodium therapy has also been effective in reducing these biochemical markers in patients with Paget's disease who failed to respond, or no longer responded to other treatments. Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer and Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma: Pamidronate disodium is indicated, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy, for the treatment of osteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer and osteolytic lesions of multiple myeloma.

Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14919542@• Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity: Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia • Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer or multiple myeloma • Paget's disease of bone.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Via takeover of generics unit of Merck KGaA@@@392@Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia; please see label for dosing ranges; the total dose of pamidronate disodium may be administered either in a single infusion or in multiple infusions over 2-4 consecutive days.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@RATIOPHARM@@@@@RATIOPHARM||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@83.46@116.5@86.79@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@16.69@16.69@1039464@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

The effects of perifosine on Akt are of particular interest because of the importance of this pathway in the development of most cancers, the evidence that it is often activated in tumors that are resistant to other forms of anticancer therapy, and the difficulty encountered thus far in the discovery of drugs that will inhibit this pathway without causing excessive toxicity. High levels of activated Akt (pAkt) are seen frequently in many types of cancer and have been correlated with poor prognosis in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma, gastric, hepatocellular, endometrial, prostate, renal cell, head and neck cancers and hematological malignancies, as well as glioblastoma. The majority of tumors expressing high levels of pAkt were high-grade, advanced stage or had other features associated with poor prognosis. High pAkt is often seen in tumors that are resistant to conventional cancer treatments, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and especially therapy with some of the newer biologicals. Published data suggest that the Akt pathway is frequently activated in renal cell cancer and that this tumor type may be particularly responsive to Akt inhibition.@@14916688@Combo with Velcade, with or without dexamethasone in patients previously treated with Velcade.@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Keryx receives notice from Nasdaq that the company is not in compliance with the US$1 minimum bid price for continued listing and most reach this within 180 days.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918336@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@1 A PHARMA@@@@@1 A PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@64.36@92.36@67.09@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@12.87@12.87@683482@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@75@MCG@75 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

False positive scan interpretations may result in: (1) inappropriate surgical intervention to confirm scan results; (2) inappropriate denial of curative therapy if results are not confirmed; or (3) inadequate surgical staging if only areas of uptake are sampled. Surgical sampling should not be limited to the areas of positive uptake, unless histologic examination of these areas is diagnostic. Due to the potential for false negative scan interpretations, negative images should not be used in lieu of histologic confirmation. Proper patient preparation is mandatory to obtain optimal images for interpretation (see Imaging Precautions, below).

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919707@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects. The differences in potencies for carboplatin and cisplatin appear to be directly related to the difference in aquation rates.@@14920019@It is indicated for the initial treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma in established combination with other approved chemotherapeutics such as Paraplatin and cyclophosphamide.

In combination with cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2 IV on day 1 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles) for previously untreated patients, 300mg/m2 IV on day every 4 weeks for 6 cycles should be used.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14925048@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@Aug-98@@NO REVIEW@@@@65%@@@@357@Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated With Highly Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy: The recommended adult oral dosage is 24 mg given as three 8-mg tablets administered 30 minutes before the start of single-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2.

The binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some but not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance gene.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922928@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma.

The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma.

Dosage recommendations may be converted from those in terms of bodyweight to those related to surface area by means of nomograms, as presented in Documenta Geigy. 1) Remission induction: a) Continuous treatment: i) Rapid injection  2 mg/kg/day is a judicious starting dose. Administer for 10 days. Obtain daily blood counts. If no antileukaemic effect is noted and there is no apparent toxicity, increase to 4 mg/kg/day and maintain until therapeutic response or toxicity is evident. Almost all patients can be carried to toxicity with these doses. ii) 0.5  1.0 mg/kg/day may be given in an infusion of up to 24 hours duration. Results from onehour infusions have been satisfactory in the majority of patients. After 10 days this initial daily dose may be increased to 2 mg/kg/day subject to toxicity. Continue to toxicity or until remission occurs. b) Intermittent treatment: 3-5 mg/kg/day are administered intravenously on each of five consecutive days. After a two to nineday rest period, a further course is given. Continue until response or toxicity occurs. The first evidence of marrow improvement has been reported to occur 7  64 days (mean 28 days) after the beginning of therapy. In general, if a patient shows neither toxicity nor remission after a fair trial, the cautious administration of higher doses is warranted. As a rule, patients have been seen to tolerate higher doses when given by rapid intravenous injection as compared with slow infusion. This difference is due to the rapid metabolism of Cytarabine and the consequent short duration of action of the high dose. 2) Maintenance therapy: Remissions which have been induced by Cytarabine, or by other drugs, may be maintained by intravenous or subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg once or twice weekly.@EMA, June 1999@@@@@@Only physicians experienced in cancer chemotherapy should use Cytarabine for Injection USP.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922927@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919625@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Novartis purchases Hexal and Eon Labs in a 5.65 billion euro deal.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro.

However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14920103@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal. Pamidronate disodium therapy in patients with Paget's disease has been effective in reducing serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels by = 50% in at least 50% of patients, and by = 30% in at least 80% of patients. Pamidronate disodium therapy has also been effective in reducing these biochemical markers in patients with Paget's disease who failed to respond, or no longer responded to other treatments.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@NOVARTIS@SANDOZ@@@@NOVARTIS|SANDOZ|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@48@71.67@50.21@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@4.8@4.8@2195657@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MCG@25 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Appropriate management of complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. Anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions characterised by dyspnea and hypotension requiring treatment, angioedema, and generalized urticaria have occurred in 2%-4% of patients in clinical trials. Fatal reactions have occurred in patients despite premedication. All patients should be pretreated with corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, and H2 antagonists. Patients who experience severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with the drug. Taxol therapy should not be given to patients with solid tumours who have baseline neutrophil counts of less than 1,500 cells/mm3 and should not be given to patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma if the baseline neutrophil count is less than 1000 cells/mm3. In order to monitor the occurrence of bone marrow suppression, primarily neutropaenia, which may be severe and result in infection, it is recommended that frequent peripheral blood cell counts be performed on all patients receiving Taxol.@CA139-174 / CA139-281@No@Sep-00@Fifty-nine of the 85 patients enrolled in these studies had previously received systemic therapy, including interferon alpha (32%), DaunoXome (31%), DOXIL (2%) and doxorubicin containing chemotherapy (42%), with 64% having received prior anthracyclines. Eightyfive percent of the pretreated patients had progressed on, or could not tolerate, prior systemic therapy.@@@II@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@Although the planned dose intensity in the two studies was slightly different (45 mg/m2/week in Study CA139-174 and 50 mg/m2 /week in Study CA139-281), delivered dose intensity was 38-39 mg/m2/week in both studies, with a similar range (20-24 to 51-61). The efficacy of pacalitaxel was evaluated by assessing cutaneous tumor response according to the amended ACTG criteria and by seeking evidence of clinical benefit in patients in six domains of symptoms and/or conditions that are commonly related to AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Cutaneous Tumor Response (Amended ACTG Criteria) - The objective response rate was 59% (95% CI: 46 to 72%)( 35 of 59 patients) in patients with prior systemic therapy. Cutaneous responses were primarily defined as flattening of more than 50% of previously raised lesions. (See Table) The median time to response was 8.1 weeks and the median duration of response measured from the first day of treatment was 10.4 months (95% CI: 7.0 to 11.0 months) for the patients who had previously received systemic therapy. The median time to progression was 6.2 months (95% CI: 4.6 to 8.7 months). Additional Clinical Benefit - Most data on patient benefit were assessed retrospectively (plans for such analyses were not included in the study protocols). Nonetheless, clinical descriptions and photographs indicated clear benefit in some patients, including instances of improved pulmonary function in patients with pulmonary involvement, improved ambulation, resolution of ulcers, and decreased analgesic requirements in patients with KS involving the feet and resolution of facial lesions and edema in patients with KS involving the face, extremities and genitalia.@@@@@MONO@PACLITAXEL@@@@@PACLITAXEL||||@BMS@@@@@BMS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Sarcoma@Kaposi's Sarcoma@@@@Sarcoma|Kaposi's Sarcoma||||||||@TAXOL@@@@@TAXOL||||@Plant Alkaloid@Taxane@@@@Plant Alkaloid|Taxane|||@RESPONSE RATE@TIME TO PROGRESSION@OVERALL SURVIVAL@@@OVERALL SURVIVAL@@@@@@@@@@RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@@@@@@Incorrect Average Duration of Use (Unit)@@@15@cycle@15 cycle@@@@1@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@00015-3479-11@INJECTION@US$@@@@@@@@300@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922194@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Novartis purchases Hexal and Eon Labs in a 5.65 billion euro deal.

Naturally occurring GnRH binds to the GnRH receptor on cells in the pituitary gland, triggering the production of luteinising hormone (LH), which subsequently stimulates the production of testosterone.  Both GnRH agonists and blockers bind to this same receptor target. Agonists work initially by stimulating release of LH and hence testosterone production, but blockers, like degarelix, directly prevent the release of LH, which means there is no surge in testosterone at the start of treatment leading to characteristic flare responses in symptoms and tumour growth.

Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors.

Bevacizumab contains human framework regions and the complementarity-determining regions of a murine antibody that binds to VEGF (1). Bevacizumab is produced in a Chinese Hamster Ovary mammalian cell expression system in a nutrient medium containing the antibiotic gentamicin and has a molecular weight of approximately 149 kilodaltons. Bevacizumab binds VEGF and prevents the interaction of VEGF to its receptors (Flt-1 and KDR) on the surface of endothelial cells. The interaction of VEGF with its receptors leads to endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation in in vitro models ofangiogenesis. Administration of Bevacizumab to xenotransplant models of colon cancer in nude (athymic) mice caused reduction of microvascular growth and inhibition of metastatic disease progression.@@14916208@First-line combo with Xeloda@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@">> Roche reaches a friendly agreement to purchase the latter's outstanding shares at a price of US$95 per share.

Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14918222@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@7-Feb@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated With Highly Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy: The recommended adult oral dosage is 24 mg given as three 8-mg tablets administered 30 minutes before the start of single-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

In some cancer cells, there is an overexpression of HDACs, or an aberrant recruitment of HDACs to oncogenic transcription factors causing hypoacetylation of core nucleosomal histones. Hypoacetylation of histones is associated with a condensed chromatin structure and repression of gene transcription. Inhibition of HDAC activity allows for the accumulation of acetyl groups on the histone lysine residues resulting in an open chromatin structure and transcriptional activation.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922530@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.

However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton. The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids. The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein. Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.

The risks of shortened survival and tumour progression have not been excluded when ESAs are dosed to target a haemoglobin of < 12 g/dL.

In clinical trials of adult CML and Ph+ ALL patients, dose escalation to 140 mg once daily (chronic phase CML) or 100 mg twice daily (advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL) was allowed in patients who did not achieve a haematologic or cytogenetic response at the recommended starting dosage.@@@@@@@Myelosuppression: Treatment is associated with severe thrombocytopaenia, neutropaenia, and anaemia. Their occurrence is more frequent in patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL than in chronic phase CML. Complete blood counts should be performed weekly for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. Myelosuppression was generally reversible and usually managed by withholding Sprycel temporarily or dose reduction. Bleeding Related Events: in addition to causing thrombocytopenia in human subjects, dasatinib caused platelet dysfunction in vitro. In all clinical studies, severe CNS haemorrhages, including fatalities, occurred in <1% of patients. Severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in 4% of patients and generally required treatment interruptions and transfusions. Fluid Retention: Sprycel is associated with fluid retention. In all clinical studies, severe fluid retention was reported in 8% of patients, including pleural and pericardial effusion reported in 5% and 1% of patients, respectively.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@1 A PHARMA@@@@@1 A PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@51.64@76.28@53.97@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@2.58@2.58@1744978@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@12@MCG@12 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@WINTHROP@SANOFI-AVENTIS@@@@WINTHROP|SANOFI-AVENTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@129.41@174.6@134.19@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@12.94@12.94@3980482@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@75@MCG@75 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918355@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@ABZ PHARMA@@@@@ABZ PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@71.1@100.88@74.04@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@3.56@3.56@2239716@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MCG@25 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Both GnRH agonists and blockers bind to this same receptor target.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917821@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

For high dose treatment, epirubicin may be given as an intravenous bolus over 3-5 minutes or as an infusion of up to 30 minutes duration.

The acute increase in plasma levels of uric acid subsequent to the lysis of large numbers of malignant cells and during cytoreductive chemotherapy may lead to impairment of renal function and renal failure resulting from the precipitation of crystals of uric acid in renal tubules. Rasburicase is a highly potent uricolytic agent that catalyses enzymatic oxidation of uric acid into allantoin, a water soluble product, easily excreted by the kidneys in the urine. The enzymatic oxidation of uric acid leads to stoichiometric formation of hydrogen peroxide. The increased of hydrogen peroxide over ambient levels can be eliminated by endogenous antioxidants and the only increased risk is for haemolysis in G6PD deficient and inherited anaemia patients.@@14917848@Treatment and prophylaxis of acute hyperuricaemia, in order to prevent acute renal failure, in patients with haematological malignancy with a high tumour burden and at risk of a rapid tumour lysis or shrinkage at initiation of chemotherapy.@@YES@NO NICE REVIEW@@NO REVIEW@@@@100%@@@@265@The recommended dose for Fasturtec is 0.20 mg/kg/day.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14921153@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@NYCOMED@@@@@NYCOMED||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@MATRIFEN@@@@@MATRIFEN||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@9@1.1511@43.17@65.56@45.23@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@4.8@4.8@7330829@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MCG@25 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

For a short dexamethasone suppression test, 1mg dexamethasone is given at 11 p.m. and plasma cortisol measured the next morning. Patients who do not show a decrease in cortisol can be exposed to a longer test: 500 micrograms dexamethasone is given at 6 hourly intervals for 48 hours followed by 2mg every 6 hours for a further 48 hours. 24 hour-urine collections are made before, during and at the end of the test for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14925046@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@357@Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated With Highly Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy: The recommended adult oral dosage is 24 mg given as three 8-mg tablets administered 30 minutes before the start of single-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14917454@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90%@Janssen Cilag is part of the Johnson & Johnson group.@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@1-Mar-98@3/1/1998@4/22/1998@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@RESTRICTED SUBSTANCE PRESCRIPTION@SNS@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@JOHNSON & JOHNSON@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@JOHNSON & JOHNSON|JANSSEN CILAG|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@DUROGESIC MATRIX@@@@@DUROGESIC MATRIX||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1807@18.74@29.25@20.24@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/23/2017@3.75@3.75@662585@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@50@MCG@50 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@217@Spain@@@@@@@@

In post-menopausal women, oestrogens are produced primarily from the conversion of androgens into oestrogens through the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Oestrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for hormone dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, Aromasin p.o. significantly lowered serum oestrogen concentrations starting from a 5 mg dose, reaching maximal suppression (>90%) with a dose of 10-25 mg. In postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with the 25 mg daily dose, whole body aromatization was reduced by 98%. Exemestane does not possess any progestogenic or oestrogenic activity. A slight androgenic activity, probably due to the 17-hydro derivative, has been observed mainly at high doses. In multiple daily doses trials, Aromasin had no detectable effects on adrenal biosynthesis of cortisol or aldosterone, measured before or after ACTH challenge, thus demonstrating its selectivity with regard to the other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway. Glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid replacements are therefore not needed. A non dose-dependent slight increase in serum LH and FSH levels has been observed even at low doses: this effect is, however, expected for the pharmacological class and is probably the result of feedback at the pituitary level due to the reduction in oestrogen levels that stimulate the pituitary secretion of gonadotropins also in postmenopausal women.@@14917923@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogenreceptor positive early breast cancer who have received two to three years of tamoxifen and are switched to Aromasin for completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy; the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@Co-pay tier 2.

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents.

14922769@Onco@@@@@300f1014ntsdm@@@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@L01AA01@L01A@NO@NEW YORK, NEW YORK@@@Cyclophosphamide is an antineoplastic agent which is converted in the body to an active alkylating metabolite. It also possesses marked immunosuppressant properties. The principal site of cyclophosphamide activation is the liver. The chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant activity of cyclophosphamide is thought to be mediated by the cytotoxic intermediates produced by activation by mixed function oxidases in hepatic microsomes. Non-enzymatic cleavage, possibly taking place in the tumour cells, results in the formulation of highly cytotoxic forms of the drug.@@14922769@Although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to Cytoxan treatment: 1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma. 2. Multiple myeloma. 3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (Cytoxan given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration). 4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). 5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). 6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 7. Retinoblastoma. 8. Carcinoma of the breast. Cytoxan is also used in non-malignant disease: it is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid therapy or in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, Cytoxan may induce a remission. Cytoxan is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.@@@@@@@@-@@@@@@When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of Cytoxan for patients with no hematologic deficiency usually consists of 40 to 50 mg/kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens include 10 to 15 mg/kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 to 5 mg/kg twice weekly. Many other regimens of intravenous and oral Cytoxan have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia. When Cytoxan is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose as well as that of the other drugs. Cytoxan and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of Cytoxan metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.@1-Nov-59@11/1/1959@@@@@Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoproliferative malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically. Urinary System: Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal. Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Cardiac Toxicity: Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium. No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Infections: Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@RAMQ@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE||||@BAXTER HEALTHCARE@@@@@BAXTER HEALTHCARE||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@Breast Cancer@Ovarian Cancer@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia|Breast Cancer|Ovarian Cancer||||||@PROCYTOX@@@@@PROCYTOX||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@562.68@562.68@@100@0.7881@47.4@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@7/19/2017@0.47@0.47@2241796100@TABLET@C$@@@@@@@@50@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@49@Canada@@@@@@@@

Doxil can also cause myelosuppression. In patients with relapsed ovarian cancer, myelosuppression was generally moderate and reversible. For patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma who often present with baseline myelosuppression due to such factors as their HIV disease or concomitant medications, myelosuppression appears to be the dose-limiting adverse event at the recommended dose of 20 mg/m2. Doxil may potentiate the toxicity of other anticancer therapies. In particular, haematologic toxicity may be more severe when it is administered in combination with other agents that cause bone marrow suppression.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Little or no binding was observed in the non-lymphoid tissues examined.@@16749482@In combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL.@Both@YES@27-Jan-10@1/27/2010@@@@@@@FIRST-LINE@NCT00281918@817@The recommended dosage of MabThera in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated and relapsed/refractory patients is 375 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 0 of the first treatment cycle followed by 500 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 1 of each subsequent cycle for 6 cycles in total.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@@JANSSEN CILAG||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@DUROGESIC SMAT@@@@@DUROGESIC SMAT||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1807@337.83@438.11@349.17@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/15/2017@16.89@16.89@575060@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

SOURCE: Lilly@@L01BA04@L01B@-@INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA@@@Pemetrexed is an antifolate containing the pyrrolopyrimidine-based nucleus that exerts its antineoplastic activity by disrupting folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumor cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues.

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14921343@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses. Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: indicated in the management of selected adults with severe, active, rheumatoid arthritis (ARC criteria), or children with active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate. Combined use of methotrexate with gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or cytotoxic agents, has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects.

[Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Leukemia: When used for induction, methotrexate in doses of 3.3 mg/m2 in combination with 60 mg/m2 of prednisone, given daily, produced remissions in 50% of patients treated, usually within a period of 4 to 6 weeks. Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia||||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@30@1.1511@4.82@17.08@5.67@@@@@@@@@@0.06@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@0.16@0.16@4939116@TABLET@EURO@@@@@@@@2.5@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922192@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Novartis purchases Hexal and Eon Labs in a 5.65 billion euro deal.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922203@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Novartis purchases Hexal and Eon Labs in a 5.65 billion euro deal.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14919543@• Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity: Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia • Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer or multiple myeloma • Paget's disease of bone.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Via takeover of generics unit of Merck KGaA@@@392@Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia; please see label for dosing ranges; the total dose of pamidronate disodium may be administered either in a single infusion or in multiple infusions over 2-4 consecutive days.

Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@WYETH@PFIZER@@@@WYETH|PFIZER|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia||||||||@METHOTREXAT LEDERLE@@@@@METHOTREXAT LEDERLE||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1.1511@409.55@528.78@423.15@@@@@@@@@@0.08@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@409.55@409.55@3027347@SOLUTION FOR INFUSION@EURO@@@@@@@@5000@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

The antineoplastic effect is due to an inhibition of cell growth which is independent of the cell cycle and due to an inhibition of DNA synthesis. An alkylating effect has also been shown and other cytostatic mechanisms may also be influenced by dacarbazine. Dacarbazine is considered not to show an antineoplastic effect by itself. However by microsomal N-demethylation it is quickly converted to 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide and a methyl cation, which is responsible for the alkylating effect of the drug.@@14918685@Dacarbazine is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.

Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia may be severe enough to cause death. Possible bone marrow depression requires careful monitoring of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelet levels. Such toxicity may necessitate temporary suspension or cessation of therapy. Hepatic toxicity, accompanied by hepatic vein thrombosis and hepatocellular necrosis resulting in death, have been reported. The incidence of such reactions has been low. This toxicity has been observed mostly when dacarbazine has been administered concomitantly with other anti-neoplastic drugs; however, it has also been reported in some patients treated with dacarbazine alone. Therefore frequent monitoring of liver size, function and blood counts (especially eosinophils) is required. It is recommended that dacarbazine be administered by physicians experienced in the use of cytotoxic therapy. Laboratory facilities should be available for blood monitoring.

Suggested dose adjustments include 125% from prior course if platelet and neutrophil counts are above 100,000 and 2,000 respectively; no adjustment if the counts are 50-100,000 or 500-2,000 respectively; and 75% if they are under 50,000 and 500 respectively.@@@@@@@Bone marrow suppression (leukopaenia, neutropaenia, and thrombocytopaenia) is dose-dependent and is also the dose-limiting toxicity. Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents. It can induce emesis, which can be more severe in patients previously receiving emetogenic therapy. The incidence and intensity of emesis have been reduced by using premedication with antiemetics.@LABEL@No@@342 ADVANCED OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS (SWOG) 447 ADVANCED OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS (NCIC)@@@III; SWOG + NCIC@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@SWOG: Carboplatin versus cisplatin: 58% (48/83) versus 43% (33/76) respectively.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919894@1.

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects. The differences in potencies for carboplatin and cisplatin appear to be directly related to the difference in aquation rates.@@14916585@It is indicated for the initial treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma in established combination with other approved chemotherapeutics such as Paraplatin and cyclophosphamide.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro.

Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal. Pamidronate disodium therapy in patients with Paget's disease has been effective in reducing serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels by = 50% in at least 50% of patients, and by = 30% in at least 80% of patients. Pamidronate disodium therapy has also been effective in reducing these biochemical markers in patients with Paget's disease who failed to respond, or no longer responded to other treatments. Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer and Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma: Pamidronate disodium is indicated, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy, for the treatment of osteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer and osteolytic lesions of multiple myeloma.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919487@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Little or no binding was observed in the non-lymphoid tissues examined.@@16749470@Treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma in combination with chemotherapy.@@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Roche announces US$43.7 billion proposal to assume full control of Genentech.

Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922189@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Novartis purchases Hexal and Eon Labs in a 5.65 billion euro deal.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919567@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14917449@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@100%@Manufactured by ALZA Corporation and distributed by Janssen Pharmaceutica Products (both subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson)@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@EMA, December 1999@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@NO NICE REVIEW@NHS@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@JOHNSON & JOHNSON@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@JOHNSON & JOHNSON|JANSSEN CILAG|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@DUROGESIC@@@@@DUROGESIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.2961@17.99@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/21/2017@3.6@3.6@9.09E+15@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@GB£@@@@@@@@25@MCG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@243@United Kingdom@@@@@@@@

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14921383@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses.

Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate. Combined use of methotrexate with gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or cytotoxic agents, has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects.

[Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Leukemia: When used for induction, methotrexate in doses of 3.3 mg/m2 in combination with 60 mg/m2 of prednisone, given daily, produced remissions in 50% of patients treated, usually within a period of 4 to 6 weeks. Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia||||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@30@1.1511@11.65@25.72@12.72@@@@@@@@@@0.08@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@0.39@0.39@4.95E+06@TABLET@EURO@@@@@@@@5@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922316@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal. Pamidronate disodium therapy in patients with Paget's disease has been effective in reducing serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels by = 50% in at least 50% of patients, and by = 30% in at least 80% of patients. Pamidronate disodium therapy has also been effective in reducing these biochemical markers in patients with Paget's disease who failed to respond, or no longer responded to other treatments. Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer and Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma: Pamidronate disodium is indicated, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy, for the treatment of osteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer and osteolytic lesions of multiple myeloma. The pamidronate disodium treatment effect appeared to be smaller in the study of breast cancer patients receiving hormonal therapy than in the study of those receiving chemotherapy, however, overall evidence of clinical benefit has been demonstrated.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Stada acquires Eurogenerics.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919647@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Sanofi acquired Sterling Winthrop in 1992.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents.

A lower initial dosage (12 mg/m2 or less) is recommended for patients with inadequate bone marrow reserves e.g. due to prior chemotherapy or poor general condition.

Mitoxantrone has also been used in various combinations for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, however data are presently limited and specific regimens cannot be recommended. As a guide, when mitoxantrone is used in combination chemotherapy with another myelosuppressive agent, the initial dose of mitoxantrone should be reduced by 2-4 mg/m2 below the doses recommended for single agent use.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs.

Trastuzumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) culture containing the antibiotic gentamicin. Gentamicin is not detectable in the final product. The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Herceptin has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Herceptin is a mediator of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, Herceptin-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2@@14920482@Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC): Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2: a) as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an anthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor positive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. b) in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable. c) in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. d) in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with hormone-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer, not previously treated with trastuzumab.   Early Breast Cancer (EBC): Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable). Herceptin should only be used in patients whose tumours have either HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14918220@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@7-Feb@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated With Highly Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy: The recommended adult oral dosage is 24 mg given as three 8-mg tablets administered 30 minutes before the start of single-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma.

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that exposure of CLL lymphocytes to 2F-ara-A triggers extensive DNA fragmentation and cell death characteristic of apoptosis.@@14917911@Treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in patients with sufficient bone marrow reserves.

[Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Leukemia: When used for induction, methotrexate in doses of 3.3 mg/m2 in combination with 60 mg/m2 of prednisone, given daily, produced remissions in 50% of patients treated, usually within a period of 4 to 6 weeks. Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia||||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@37@57.76@38.86@@@@@@@@@@0.49@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@3.7@3.7@4767721@SOLUTION FOR INJECTION (1 ML)@EURO@@@@@@@@7.5@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@WINTHROP@SANOFI-AVENTIS@@@@WINTHROP|SANOFI-AVENTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@335.85@435.6@347.13@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@16.79@16.79@3981464@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922097@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal. Pamidronate disodium therapy in patients with Paget's disease has been effective in reducing serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels by = 50% in at least 50% of patients, and by = 30% in at least 80% of patients.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919785@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor.

Genta currently plans to pursue both of these options.

Decision appealed in April 2007 and the appeal was completed in October 2007.This appeal has been submitted in accordance with the Formal Dispute Resolution process that exists within CDER. The appeal reflects several considerations, including but not limited to the following:•    Complete responses  – the primary endpoint of the trial – were more than doubled in the Genasense group compared with controls who received chemotherapy alone.  The difference was statistically significant.•    Complete response confers clinical benefit in CLL.  By definition, a complete response requires elimination of all evidence of disease, normalization of blood counts, and resolution of symptoms.•    The median duration of complete response in patients who received Genasense has exceeded 3 years, at least 50% longer compared with controls, which is clinically meaningful and statistically significant.  Survival information from this study will be updated at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in December 2007.•    The Genasense study is the only randomized controlled trial ever conducted in this population.•    The number, type, and severity of adverse reactions encountered with Genasense were comparable to other leukemia drugs, which are readily managed by specialists.Responses to CDER appeals are typically made within 30 to 60 days, but FDA has extended its review, which will now be completed sometime in Q108.

In postmenopausal women, oestrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens - primarily androstenedione and testosterone - to oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2). The suppression of oestrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Letrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the haem of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of oestrogen biosynthesis in all tissues.@@14917853@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive invasive early breast cancer.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919473@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Idarubicin has been shown to have a higher potency with respect to daunorubicin and to be an effective agent against murine leukaemia and lymphomas both by i.v. and oral routes.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

Under the conditions of the assays, dasatinib was able to overcome imatinib resistance resulting from BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, activation of alternate signaling pathways involving the SRC family kinases (LYN, HCK), and multi-drug resistance gene overexpression.@@15361224@Indicated for the treatment of adults with Chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib.@@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@REIMBURSEMENT RANGES FROM 100% TO 70% DEPENDING ON SUB-POPULATIONS@@@@22@The recommended starting dosage for chronic phase CML is 100 mg once daily, administered orally, consistently either in the morning or in the evening.

Administer for 10 days. Obtain daily blood counts. If no antileukaemic effect is noted and there is no apparent toxicity, increase to 4 mg/kg/day and maintain until therapeutic response or toxicity is evident. Almost all patients can be carried to toxicity with these doses. ii) 0.5  1.0 mg/kg/day may be given in an infusion of up to 24 hours duration. Results from onehour infusions have been satisfactory in the majority of patients. After 10 days this initial daily dose may be increased to 2 mg/kg/day subject to toxicity. Continue to toxicity or until remission occurs. b) Intermittent treatment: 3-5 mg/kg/day are administered intravenously on each of five consecutive days. After a two to nineday rest period, a further course is given. Continue until response or toxicity occurs. The first evidence of marrow improvement has been reported to occur 7  64 days (mean 28 days) after the beginning of therapy. In general, if a patient shows neither toxicity nor remission after a fair trial, the cautious administration of higher doses is warranted. As a rule, patients have been seen to tolerate higher doses when given by rapid intravenous injection as compared with slow infusion. This difference is due to the rapid metabolism of Cytarabine and the consequent short duration of action of the high dose. 2) Maintenance therapy: Remissions which have been induced by Cytarabine, or by other drugs, may be maintained by intravenous or subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg once or twice weekly.@Sep-87@@@@@@Only physicians experienced in cancer chemotherapy should use Cytarabine for Injection USP.

This cycle of JX-594 replication, cancer cell destruction, release and spread is then repeated. Normal cells are not affected by JX-594 resulting in safety and tolerability. The poxvirus strain backbone of JX-594 has been used safely in millions of people as part of a worldwide vaccination program against smallpox. This strain naturally targets cancer cells due to common genetic defects in cancer cells. JX-594 was engineered to enhance this natural safety and cancer-selectivity by deleting its thymidine kinase (TK) gene, thus making it dependent on the cellular TK expressed at persistently high levels in cancer cells. To enhance product efficacy, JX-594 is also engineered to express the GM-CSF protein. GM-CSF complements the cancer cell lysis work of the product candidate, leading to a cascade of events resulting in tumor necrosis, tumor vasculature shutdown and an anti-tumoral immune attack. @@14924533@-@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Jennerex Biotherapeutics announced an agreement with Green Cross Corp., South Korea for the development and commercialization in Korea of JX-594 , an oncolytic vaccinia virus for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) as the initial indication.

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor.

TS is a key enzyme in the de novo synthesis of thymidine triphosphate (TTP), a nucleotide required exclusively for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis. Inhibition of TS leads to DNA fragmentation and cell death. Raltitrexed is transported into cells via a reduced folate carrier (RFC) and is then extensively polyglutamated by the enzyme folyl polyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) to polyglutamate forms that are retained in cells and are even more potent inhibitors of TS. Raltitrexed polyglutamation enhances TS inhibitory potency and increases the duration of TS inhibition in cells which may improve antitumour activity.

NEUPOGEN containing rmetHuGCSF (filgrastim) causes marked increases in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within twenty-four hours, with minor increases in monocytes. In some severe chronic neutropenia patients filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and basophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia already prior to treatment. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dosedependent at recommended doses. Neutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function.

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that exposure of CLL lymphocytes to 2F-ara-A triggers extensive DNA fragmentation and cell death characteristic of apoptosis.@@14917917@Treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in patients with sufficient bone marrow reserves.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@167.91@223.28@173.9@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@16.79@16.79@4432446@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

VEGF and PDGF are growth factors critical to the development and growth of blood vessels - a process known as angiogenesis. Angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in the growth and spread of several tumour types, with VEGF and PDGF overexpression linked to multiple cancers including cancers of the liver, lung, breast, kidney, bladder, ovaries, and colon. By inhibiting VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-kit pazopanib may stop or slow the rate of tumour growth and development. Pazopanib is currently being studied in a number of different tumour types; clinical trials are currently underway in renal cell carcinoma (Phase III), breast cancer (Phase III in inflammatory breast cancer), ovarian cancer, STS, NSCLC, cervical cancer and other solid tumours. It is being evaluated as a monotherapy, in combination with targeted therapies and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy.@@14925087@Votrient is used to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma (a type of kidney cancer).

The recommended escalation schedule is as follows: Days 1 – 3 3 million IU daily; Days 4 – 6 9 million IU daily; Days 7 – 9 18 million IU daily and, if tolerated, increase to: Days 10 – 84 36 million IU daily. Maintenance dosage: Roferon-A should be given by subcutaneous injection three times per week at the maximum dose which is acceptable to the patient, but not exceeding 36 million IU. Patients with AIDSrelated Kaposi's sarcoma treated with 3 million IU of Roferon-A given daily showed a lower response rate than those treated with the recommended dosage.@1-Nov-99@11/1/1999@10/14/2000@@@@Roferon-A should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the management of the respective indication. Appropriate management of the therapy and its complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. Patients should be informed not only of the benefits of therapy but also that they will probably experience adverse reactions. Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately. Psychiatric intervention and/or drug discontinuation should be considered in such cases. Ophthalmologic: As with other interferons, retinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis and optic neuropathy which may result in loss of vision, have been reported after treatment with Roferon-A. Any patient complaining of decrease or loss of vision must have an eye examination. Because these ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual examination prior to initiation of Roferon-A monotherapy or in the combination therapy with ribavirin is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.

Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919652@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Sanofi acquired Sterling Winthrop in 1992.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose.

When toxic signs resulting from the initial course of therapy have subsided, administer a maintenance dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/week as a single dose. Do not exceed 1 g per week.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919617@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Dr. Reddy's purchases Betapharm from 3i.

The compound has a high lipophilicity which results in an increased rate of cellular uptake compared with doxorubicin and daunorubicin. Idarubicin has been shown to have a higher potency with respect to daunorubicin and to be an effective agent against murine leukaemia and lymphomas both by i.v. and oral routes. Studies in-vitro on human and murine anthracycline-resistant cells have shown a lower degree of cross-resistance for idarubicin compared with doxorubicin and daunorubicin. Cardiotoxicity studies in animals have indicated that idarubicin has a better therapeutic index than daunorubicin and doxorubicin. The main metabolite, idarubicinol, has shown in-vitro and in-vivo antitumoral activity in experimental models. In the rat, idarubicinol, administered at the same doses as the parent drug, is clearly less cardiotoxic than idarubicin.@@14920593@Idamycin in combination with other approved antileukemic drugs is indicated for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in adults.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Acquired via takeover of Pharmacia Corp.@FIRST-LINE@@130@Idamycin 12 mg/m2 daily for 3 days by slow (10 to 15 min) intravenous injection in combination with cytarabine.

[Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@63.64@91.45@66.35@@@@@@@@@@0.42@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@6.36@6.36@4767744@SOLUTION FOR INJECTION (2 ML)@EURO@@@@@@@@15@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@
