Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38.

Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-strand breaks.@@14917194@CAMPTO is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer as a single agent in patients who have failed an established 5-fluorouracil containing treatment regimen.@@YES@5-Aug@@NICE: first-line combination combination with 5-FU/FA ICER £14,000 per QALY gained compared with 5-FU/FA@@@@100%@Licensed from Yakult Honsha Co., LTD, Japan, and Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., LTD, Japan@SECOND-LINE@@683@The recommended dosage of CAMPTO is 350 mg/m² administered as an intravenous infusion over a 30- to 90- minute period every three weeks.Treatment with CAMPTO should be continued until there is an objective progression of the disease or an unacceptable toxicity.@EMA, September 1995@@@@@@Can induce both early and late forms of diarrhea.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer. Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs (PDGFR, RET, or KIT) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRß- and VEGFR2-dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo.@@15299358@Well-differentiated pancreatic islet cell tumours@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Acquired through takeover of Pharmacia Corp., which acquired it from Sugen@@NCT00428597@340@@FDA, 20 May 2011@5/20/2011@@@@3/1/2007@@A6181111@No@JANUARY 2011 (NCE EXCLUSIVITY); FEBRUARY 2021 (GIST PATENT)@@@@III@APPROVED@@@@Data from the trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed SUTENT more than doubled median PFS compared with placebo (11.4 versus 5.5 months, p<0.0001), which was found to be consistent in a blinded, independent central review of scans from the study (12.6 versus 5.8 months, p=0.000015).

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14916911@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@YES@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@392@Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia; please see label for dosing ranges; the total dose of pamidronate disodium may be administered either in a single infusion or in multiple infusions over 2-4 consecutive days.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

The ability of Ethyol to differentially protect normal tissues is attributed to the higher capillary alkaline phosphatase activity, higher pH and better vascularity of normal tissues relative to tumor tissue, which results in a more rapid generation of the active thiol metabolite as well as a higher rate constant for uptake into cells.

14920329@Onco@@@@@300f1012ntsdm@@@@@@7-8 wafers implanted; chemo withheld at least 4 weeks prior to and 2 weeks after surgery@@@@NO@@@@Gliadel Wafer is designed to deliver carmustine directly into the surgical cavity created when a brain tumor is resected. On exposure to the aqueous environment of the resection cavity, the anhydride bonds in the copolymer are hydrolyzed, releasing carmustine, carboxyphenoxypropane, and sebacic acid. The carmustine released from Gliadel Wafer diffuses into the surrounding brain tissue and produces an antineoplastic effect by alkylating DNA and RNA. Carmustine has been shown to degrade both spontaneously and metabolically. The production of an alkylating moiety, hypothesized to be chloroethyl carbonium ion, leads to the formation of DNA cross-links. The tumoricidal activity of Gliadel Wafer is dependent on release of carmustine to the tumor cavity in concentrations sufficient for effective cytotoxicity. More than 70% of the copolymer degrades by three weeks.The metabolic disposition and excretion of the monomers differ. Carboxyphenoxypropane is eliminated by the kidney and sebacic acid, an endogenous fatty acid, is metabolized by the liver and expired as CO2 in animals. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the copolymer in humans is unknown. Carmustine concentrations delivered by Gliadel Wafer in human brain tissue have not been determined. Plasma levels of carmustine after Gliadel Wafer implant were not determined. In rabbits implanted with wafers containing 3.85% carmustine, no detectible levels of carmustine were found in the plasma or cerebrospinal fluid. Following an intravenous infusion of carmustine at doses ranging from 30 to 170 mg/m2, the average terminal half-life, clearance, and steady-state volume of distribution were 22 minutes, 56 mL/min/kg, and 3.25 L/kg, respectively. Approximately 60% of the intravenous 200 mg/m2 dose of 14C-carmustine was excreted in the urine over 96 hours and 6% was expired as CO2. Gliadel Wafers are biodegradable in human brain when implanted into the cavity after tumor resection. The rate of biodegradation is variable from patient to patient. During the biodegradation process, a wafer remnant may be observed on brain imaging scans or at re-operation even though extensive degradation of all components has occurred. Data obtained from review of CT scans obtained 49 days after implantation of Gliadel Wafer demonstrated that images consistent with wafers were visible to varying degrees in the scans of 11 of 18 patients. Data obtained at re-operation and autopsies have demonstrated wafer remnants up to 232 days after Gliadel Wafer implantation. Wafer remnants removed at reoperation from two patients with recurrent malignant glioma, one at 64 days and the second at 92 days after implantation, were analyzed for content.

Grand mal seizures occurred in 5% of Gliadel-treated patients and 4.2% of placebo-treated patients. The incidence of seizures within the first 5 days after wafer implantation was 2.5% in the Gliadel group and 4.2% in the placebo group. In the surgery for recurrent disease trial, the incidence of post-operative seizures was 19% in both patients receiving Gliadel and placebo. In this study, 12/22 (54%) of patients treated with Gliadel and 2/22 (9%) of placebo patients experienced the first new or worsened seizure within the first five post-operative days. The median time to onset of the first new or worsened post-operative seizure was 3.5 days in patients treated with Gliadel and 61 days in placebo patients.Brain Edema:In the initial surgery trial, brain edema was noted in 22.5% of patients treated with Gliadel and in 19.2% of patients treated with placebo. Development of brain edema with mass effect (due to tumor recurrences, intracranial infection, or necrosis) may necessitate re-operation and, in some cases, removal of Gliadel or its remnants.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

14918374@Onco@@@@@300f1012ntsdm@@@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@N02AB03@N02A@YES@RADEBEUL, GERMANY@@@Fentanyl is a synthetic opiate with a clinical potency of 50 to 100 times that of morphine. Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918374@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@AWD PHARMA@@@@@AWD PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@19.14@35.18@20.44@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@1.91@1.91@254700@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@12@MCG@12 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919615@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@>> Daiichi-Sankyo has agreed the purchase of a 34.8% stake in Indian generics giant Ranbaxy owned by the Singh family, and is seeking to acquire an additional 20% stake.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation.

[Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@37@57.76@38.86@@@@@@@@@@0.49@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@3.7@3.7@4767721@SOLUTION FOR INJECTION (1 ML)@EURO@@@@@@@@7.5@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14920119@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal. Pamidronate disodium therapy in patients with Paget's disease has been effective in reducing serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels by = 50% in at least 50% of patients, and by = 30% in at least 80% of patients. Pamidronate disodium therapy has also been effective in reducing these biochemical markers in patients with Paget's disease who failed to respond, or no longer responded to other treatments. Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer and Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma: Pamidronate disodium is indicated, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy, for the treatment of osteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer and osteolytic lesions of multiple myeloma.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses. Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: indicated in the management of selected adults with severe, active, rheumatoid arthritis (ARC criteria), or children with active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate. Combined use of methotrexate with gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or cytotoxic agents, has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects. Rest and physiotherapy as indicated should be continued.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@N/A@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@BEDFORD LABORATORIES@@@@@BEDFORD LABORATORIES||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@10@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@55390-0034-10@INJECTION@US$@@@@@@@@250@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Little or no binding was observed in the non-lymphoid tissues examined.@@16749488@In combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL.@Both@NA@@@@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@SECOND-LINE@NCT00090051@552@The recommended dosage of MabThera in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated and relapsed/refractory patients is 375 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 0 of the first treatment cycle followed by 500 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 1 of each subsequent cycle for 6 cycles in total.

Trastuzumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) culture containing the antibiotic gentamicin. Gentamicin is not detectable in the final product. The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor.

14917434@Onco@@@@@300f1012ntsdm@@@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@N02AB03@N02A@YES@BEERSE, BELGIUM@@@Fentanyl is a synthetic opiate with a clinical potency of 50 to 100 times that of morphine. Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14917434@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@@JANSSEN CILAG||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@DUROGESIC SMAT@@@@@DUROGESIC SMAT||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1807@64.36@92.36@67.09@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/15/2017@12.87@12.87@575031@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@75@MCG@75 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Little or no binding was observed in the non-lymphoid tissues examined.@@16792889@Relapsed or refractory, follicular lymphoma (FL) as a single agent@Both@NA@@@@@@@@@@NCT01200758@410@The recommended dose is RITUXAN HYCELA 1,400 mg/23,400 Units (1,400 mg rituximab and 23,400 Units hyaluronidase human) subcutaneously at a fixed dose irrespective of patient's body surface area.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@AWD PHARMA@@@@@AWD PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@17.66@33.31@18.91@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@3.53@3.53@821300@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MCG@25 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

In recent years, it has been widely published that aberrant Hedgehog signaling may contribute to the growth of certain cancers, including basal cell carcinoma, breast, colorectal, esophageal, pancreatic, prostrate and small cell lung cancers, among others.  Curis' preclinical evidence suggests that Hedgehog protein produced by tumor cells may signal adjacent stromal cells within the tumor environment to produce various growth and angiogenic factors that can enhance tumor maintenance and growth. Systemic administration of small molecule Hedgehog signaling pathway inhibitors has been shown to slow or halt the progression of various types of tumors in our preclinical models of cancer. Curis' believes that its small molecule Hedgehog pathway antagonists are selectively targeting fundamental mechanisms involved in the maintenance and progression of tumor growth and, as such, may represent a new generation of cancer therapeutics. @@14916447@Maintenance therapy in patients with ovarian cancer in a second or third complete remission@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@">> Roche reaches a friendly agreement to purchase the latter's outstanding shares at a price of US$95 per share.

The suppression of oestrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

The drug may act by mitotic inhibition, causing an arrest of cell division in metaphase. The drug is relatively marrow-sparing and is thus suitable for use in combination with other cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Vincristine is poorly absorbed orally. The clearance of the drug after rapid intravenous injection follows a triphasic decay pattern: a very rapid steep descent (alpha phase); a narrow-middle region (beta-phase) and a much longer terminal region (gamma phase). The terminal phase half-life of the drug varies from 15-155 hours. Dosing with the drug more frequently than once weekly is therefore probably unnecessary. Vincristine is primarily excreted by the biliary route. Patients with impaired hepatic or biliary function, as evidenced by a raised serum alkaline phosphatase, have been shown to have a significantly prolonged vincristine elimination half-life.@@14919833@Vincristine sulphate is used either alone or in conjunction with other oncolytic drugs for the treatment of:  1.

In ICON7, chemotherapy-naïve ovarian cancer patients who received Avastin in combination with standard chemotherapy and then continued Avastin alone had about 27% improvement in the likelihood of living longer without the disease worsening (progression-free survival or PFS) compared to those women who received only chemotherapy, (hazard ratio = 0.79, p=<0.0010, corresponding to a 21% reduction in risk of cancer progression or death). GOG0218 was conducted with a higher dose of Avastin and longer treatment duration than ICON7. The 3-arm design of the GOG218 trial allowed conclusion that continued use of Avastin for a longer treatment duration improved outcome in this setting. Overall survival data for both studies are currently immature and favour numerically the Avastin-containing study arms. Ovarian cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and the eighth leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Surgery to remove as much of the tumour as possible is a mainstay of treatment but is not adequate for the majority of cases, which are diagnosed late when the cancer has grown extensively or spread, and further chemotherapy is often recommended.

This metabolite is believed to be responsible for the reduction of the cumulative renal toxicity of cisplatin and for the reduction of the toxic effects of radiation on normal oral tissues. The ability of Ethyol to differentially protect normal tissues is attributed to the higher capillary alkaline phosphatase activity, higher pH and better vascularity of normal tissues relative to tumor tissue, which results in a more rapid generation of the active thiol metabolite as well as a higher rate constant for uptake into cells. The higher concentration of the thiol metabolite in normal tissues is available to bind to, and thereby detoxify, reactive metabolites of cisplatin. This thiol metabolite can also scavenge reactive oxygen species generated by exposure to either cisplatin or radiation.@@14917737@Indicated to reduce the cumulative renal toxicity associated with repeated administration of cisplatin in patients with advanced ovarian cancer; to reduce the incidence of moderate to severe xerostomia in patients undergoing post-operative radiation treatment for head and neck cancer, where the radiation port includes a substantial portion of the parotid glands@@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@>> Pinnacle Biologics purchased rights for Ethyol in Western Europe, Turkey and Israel.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14917879@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@MIBE@@@@@MIBE||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@FENTADOLON@@@@@FENTADOLON||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@161.72@215.45@167.51@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@16.17@16.17@1914558@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism.

Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@NYCOMED@@@@@NYCOMED||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@MATRIFEN@@@@@MATRIFEN||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@9@1.1511@150.99@201.88@156.44@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@16.78@16.78@7330574@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

A primary growth factor for erythroid development, erythropoietin is produced in the kidney and released into the bloodstream in response to hypoxia. In responding to hypoxia, erythropoietin interacts with progenitor stem cells to increase red blood cell (RBC) production. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is impaired in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), and erythropoietin deficiency is the primary cause of their anemia.

In the first, the use of darbepoetin alfa was considered over 25 weeks. The second included a time horizon of almost 3 years coupled with a treatment survival advantage (mean HR = 0.88). The associated ICERs for the two scenarios were approximately £160,000 and £24,000 per additional QALY gained, respectively.  In the base case of the Assessment Group's economic analysis, survival was assumed to be the same for both treatment and control arms (that is, a HR of 1 was used).

The results of the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that erythropoietin analogues became more cost effective as the threshold haemoglobin concentration for initiating an erythropoietin analogue was reduced to lower levels, but the ICERs still remained high. The most favourable ICERs were obtained if a baseline haemoglobin concentration of 8 g/100 ml was assumed for all participants. These were in the range of £65,000–£80,000 per additional QALY gained.

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14919870@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses. Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: indicated in the management of selected adults with severe, active, rheumatoid arthritis (ARC criteria), or children with active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate. Combined use of methotrexate with gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or cytotoxic agents, has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects. Rest and physiotherapy as indicated should be continued.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Via Mayne@@@@Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@N/A@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HOSPIRA@@@@@HOSPIRA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1@35.8@@@@@@@@@@@@0.14@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/2/2017@7.16@7.16@61703-0350-38@INJECTION - 2 ML@US$@@@@@@@@50@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

In postmenopausal women, oestrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens - primarily androstenedione and testosterone - to oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2). The suppression of oestrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Letrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the haem of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of oestrogen biosynthesis in all tissues.@@14917849@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive invasive early breast cancer.

Vidaza appears to exhibit its effects, inhibition of hypermethylation and direct toxicity, when cells are actively dividing.1 Because all cells are not in the same phase simultaneously, longer treatment time will expose more rapidly dividing cells to Vidaza.

Increased clusterin production is observed in many human cancers, including prostate, non-small cell lung, breast, ovarian, bladder, renal, pancreatic, anaplastic large cell lymphoma and colon cancers and melanoma. Increased clusterin production is linked to faster rates of cancer progression, treatment resistance and shorter survival duration. Clusterin levels may be further increased in response to standard cancer therapies, including hormone ablation therapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Clusterin expression is linked to disease progression, treatment resistance, poor prognosis and survival in scientific publications. For example, increased expression of clusterin in prostate cancer is closely correlated with increasing Gleason score, which is a strong prognostic factor for poor survival of patients with prostate cancer.@@14916779@Treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@"OncoGenex has decided to independently develop its lead cancer compound OGX-011, after amending a deal inked with Isis in 2001.

Comparison of baseline serum clusterin levels to the post-treatment average levels showed a significant reduction (p < 0.0001). In addition, average serum clusterin levels were predictive of survival, with low-average levels predicting median survival time of 14.7 months compared to high-average levels predicting median survival time of 5.5 months.

The effects of perifosine on Akt are of particular interest because of the importance of this pathway in the development of most cancers, the evidence that it is often activated in tumors that are resistant to other forms of anticancer therapy, and the difficulty encountered thus far in the discovery of drugs that will inhibit this pathway without causing excessive toxicity. High levels of activated Akt (pAkt) are seen frequently in many types of cancer and have been correlated with poor prognosis in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma, gastric, hepatocellular, endometrial, prostate, renal cell, head and neck cancers and hematological malignancies, as well as glioblastoma. The majority of tumors expressing high levels of pAkt were high-grade, advanced stage or had other features associated with poor prognosis. High pAkt is often seen in tumors that are resistant to conventional cancer treatments, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and especially therapy with some of the newer biologicals. Published data suggest that the Akt pathway is frequently activated in renal cell cancer and that this tumor type may be particularly responsive to Akt inhibition.@@14916697@Advanced cancers@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Keryx receives notice from Nasdaq that the company is not in compliance with the US$1 minimum bid price for continued listing and most reach this within 180 days.

PD-L1 may be expressed on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells and can contribute to the inhibition of the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironment. Binding of PD-L1 to the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors found on T cells and antigen presenting cells suppressescytotoxic T-cell activity, T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Avelumab binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors PD-1 and B7.1. This interaction releases the inhibitory effects of PD-L1 on the immune response resulting in the restoration ofimmune responses, including anti-tumor immune responses. Avelumab has also been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-L1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth.@@16670246@Treatment of adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).@Both@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@NCT02155647@88@The recommended dose of BAVENCIO is 10 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.@FDA, 23 March 2017@3/23/2017@@NA@@6/1/2014@@100070-003,  2014-000445-79@No@@Signed written informed consent; Age 18 years and above; Histologically proven MCC; Subjects must have received at least 1 line of chemotherapy for metastatic MCC and must have progressed after the most recent line of chemotherapy; For Part B - Subjects must not have received any prior systemic treatment for metastatic MCC.

In some severe chronic neutropenia patients filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and basophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia already prior to treatment. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dosedependent at recommended doses. Neutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function.

If after ten days neither therapeutic response not toxicity has been observed, the dose may be increased to 4 mg/kg until a therapeutic response or toxicity is evident. Daily blood counts should be taken. Almost all patients can be carried to toxicity with these doses. Alternatively, 0.5 to 1 mg/kg may be infused daily in 1-24 hours for ten days, and then at a rate of 2 mg/kg/day until toxicity is observed. Continue to toxicity or until remission occurs. Results from one hour infusions have been satisfactory in the majority of patients. Intermittent dosing: Cytarabine may be given as intermittent intravenous doses of 3-5 mg/kg daily, for five consecutive days. This course of treatment can be repeated after an interval of 2 to 9 days, and repeated until the therapeutic response or toxicity is exhibited. Evidence of bone marrow improvement has been reported to occur 7-64 days days after the beginning of therapy. In general, if a patient shows neither remission or toxicity after a trial period, then cautiously administered higher doses can be administered. Generally patients tolerate higher doses given by rapid intravenous injection rather than slow infusion. As a single agent for induction of remissions in patients with acute leukaemia, cytarabine has been given in doses of 200 mg/m2 by continuous intravenous infusion for five days at approximately 2 week intervals. Maintainance therapy: To maintain remission, doses of 1-1.5 mg/kg may be given intravenously or subcutaneously, once or twice weekly. Myelosuppression, anaemia and thrombocytopenia occur almost to all patients given daily infusions or injections. Myelosuppression is biphasic and nadirs at 7-9 and 15-24 days.

Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions.Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@N/A@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM@@@@@BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@100@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@INJECTION@US$@@@@@@@@2.5@MG@2.5 MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

The drug may act by mitotic inhibition, causing an arrest of cell division in metaphase. The drug is relatively marrow-sparing and is thus suitable for use in combination with other cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Vincristine is poorly absorbed orally. The clearance of the drug after rapid intravenous injection follows a triphasic decay pattern: a very rapid steep descent (alpha phase); a narrow-middle region (beta-phase) and a much longer terminal region (gamma phase). The terminal phase half-life of the drug varies from 15-155 hours. Dosing with the drug more frequently than once weekly is therefore probably unnecessary. Vincristine is primarily excreted by the biliary route.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@NO NICE REVIEW@NHS@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@JOHNSON & JOHNSON@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@JOHNSON & JOHNSON|JANSSEN CILAG|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@DUROGESIC@@@@@DUROGESIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.2961@46.99@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/21/2017@9.4@9.4@9.09E+15@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@GB£@@@@@@@@75@MCG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@243@United Kingdom@@@@@@@@

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922295@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone.

ALL: Given as a single agent for remission induction, Purinethol induces complete remission in approximately 25% of paediatric patients and 10% of adults. However, reliance upon Purinethol alone is not justified for initial remission induction of ALL since combination chemotherapy with vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase results in more frequent complete remission induction than with Purinethol alone or in combination. The duration of complete remission induced in ALL is so brief without the use of maintenance therapy that some form of drug therapy is considered essential. Purinethol, as a single agent, is capable of significantly prolonging complete remission duration; however, combination therapy has produced remission duration longer than that achieved with Purinethol alone. AML: As a single agent, it will induce complete remission in approximately 10% of pediatric patients and adults with acute myelogenous leukemia or its subclassifications.

A usual daily maintenance dose is 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg/day as a single dose.@@@@@@@Bone Marrow Toxicity: The most consistent, dose-related toxicity is bone marrow suppression. This may be manifest by anaemia, leukopaenia, thrombocytopaenia, or any combination of these. Any of these findings may also reflect progression of the underlying disease. Since mercaptopurine may have a delayed effect, it is important to withdraw the medication temporarily at the first sign of an abnormally large fall in any of the formed elements of the blood. There are individuals with an inherited deficiency of the enzyme TPMT who may be unusually sensitive to the myelosuppressive effects of mercaptopurine and prone to developing rapid bone marrow suppression following the initiation of treatment. Substantial dosage reductions may be required to avoid the development of life-threatening bone marrow suppression in these patients. This toxicity may be more profound in patients treated with concomitant allopurinol. This problem could be exacerbated by coadministration with drugs that inhibit TPMT, such as olsalazine, mesalazine, or sulphasalazine.

The efficacy of pacalitaxel was evaluated by assessing cutaneous tumor response according to the amended ACTG criteria and by seeking evidence of clinical benefit in patients in six domains of symptoms and/or conditions that are commonly related to AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Cutaneous Tumor Response (Amended ACTG Criteria) - The objective response rate was 59% (95% CI: 46 to 72%)( 35 of 59 patients) in patients with prior systemic therapy. Cutaneous responses were primarily defined as flattening of more than 50% of previously raised lesions. (See Table) The median time to response was 8.1 weeks and the median duration of response measured from the first day of treatment was 10.4 months (95% CI: 7.0 to 11.0 months) for the patients who had previously received systemic therapy. The median time to progression was 6.2 months (95% CI: 4.6 to 8.7 months). Additional Clinical Benefit - Most data on patient benefit were assessed retrospectively (plans for such analyses were not included in the study protocols). Nonetheless, clinical descriptions and photographs indicated clear benefit in some patients, including instances of improved pulmonary function in patients with pulmonary involvement, improved ambulation, resolution of ulcers, and decreased analgesic requirements in patients with KS involving the feet and resolution of facial lesions and edema in patients with KS involving the face, extremities and genitalia.@@@@@MONO@PACLITAXEL@@@@@PACLITAXEL||||@BMS@@@@@BMS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Sarcoma@Kaposi's Sarcoma@@@@Sarcoma|Kaposi's Sarcoma||||||||@TAXOL@@@@@TAXOL||||@Plant Alkaloid@Taxane@@@@Plant Alkaloid|Taxane|||@RESPONSE RATE@TIME TO PROGRESSION@OVERALL SURVIVAL@@@OVERALL SURVIVAL@@@@@@@@@@RANDOMISED@OPEN-LABEL@@@@@@Incorrect Average Duration of Use (Unit)@@@15@cycle@15 cycle@3937.5@3937.5@262.5@1@1.1511@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@9219467R@SOLUTION TO DILUTE FOR PERFUSION, 50 ML@EURO@@@@@@@@300@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@85@France@@@@@@@@

Duration of response (DOR) was an additional outcome measure.  The trial enrolled 106 patients who had received at least one prior therapy with 17p deletion, as detected by an FDA-approved CLL fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe kit.  Patients had a median of 2.5 prior treatments (range 1-10). The ORR by IRC was 80% (95% CI: 71%, 87%) with 8% complete remission (including 2% complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery).

The most common (greater than or equal to 20%) adverse reactions of any grade were neutropenia, diarrhea, nausea, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 44% of patients, and the most common (greater than or equal to 2%) serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, pyrexia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, anemia, and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Due to a rapid reduction in tumor volume, TLS is an important identified risk when initiating venetoclax. The risk of TLS is reduced with stratification by tumor burden, prophylaxis with hydration and anti-hyperuricemics, frequent blood chemistry monitoring and correction of electrolyte abnormalities. In patients with higher risk features, hospitalization for IV hydration, electrolyte monitoring, and aggressive correction of electrolyte abnormalities may be required. In 66 patients with CLL starting with a daily dose of 20 mg and increasing over 5 weeks to a daily dose of 400 mg, the rate of TLS was 6% with no clinical events.

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14920244@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses.

Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate. Combined use of methotrexate with gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or cytotoxic agents, has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects.

Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@N/A@@@-@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@-@-@@@-@APPROVED@@@SSN@NO LABELLED TRIAL@-@@@@-@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@WYETH@PFIZER@@@@WYETH|PFIZER|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@-@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@-@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@4@1.1229@22.15@36.55@23.14@@@@@@@@@@0.55@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@6/7/2017@5.54@5.54@19888128@PREPARATION FOR INJECTION (SYRINGE)@EURO@@@@@@@@10@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@119@Italy@@@@@@@@

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918461@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@RIEMSER ARZNEIMITTEL@@@@@RIEMSER ARZNEIMITTEL||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@PATCH, TRANSDERMAL@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

In post-menopausal women, oestrogens are produced primarily from the conversion of androgens into oestrogens through the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Oestrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for hormone dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, Aromasin p.o. significantly lowered serum oestrogen concentrations starting from a 5 mg dose, reaching maximal suppression (>90%) with a dose of 10-25 mg. In postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with the 25 mg daily dose, whole body aromatization was reduced by 98%. Exemestane does not possess any progestogenic or oestrogenic activity. A slight androgenic activity, probably due to the 17-hydro derivative, has been observed mainly at high doses. In multiple daily doses trials, Aromasin had no detectable effects on adrenal biosynthesis of cortisol or aldosterone, measured before or after ACTH challenge, thus demonstrating its selectivity with regard to the other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway. Glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid replacements are therefore not needed. A non dose-dependent slight increase in serum LH and FSH levels has been observed even at low doses: this effect is, however, expected for the pharmacological class and is probably the result of feedback at the pituitary level due to the reduction in oestrogen levels that stimulate the pituitary secretion of gonadotropins also in postmenopausal women.@@14916966@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogenreceptor positive early breast cancer who have received two to three years of tamoxifen and are switched to Aromasin for completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy; the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy.@@NO@@@NICE: for unplanned swtich therapy 45% likely to be £20,000 per QALY and 80% to be £30,000@@@@100%@@SECOND-LINE@@4724@The recommended dose of Aromasin in early and advanced breast cancer is one 25 mg tablet once daily after a meal.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14920095@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with pamidronate disodium. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium injection in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or with other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established. Paget's Disease: Pamidronate disodium is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of pamidronate disodium was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase = 3 times the upper limit of normal. Pamidronate disodium therapy in patients with Paget's disease has been effective in reducing serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels by = 50% in at least 50% of patients, and by = 30% in at least 80% of patients. Pamidronate disodium therapy has also been effective in reducing these biochemical markers in patients with Paget's disease who failed to respond, or no longer responded to other treatments.

Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia||||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@21@37.54@22.37@@@@@@@@@@0.42@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@2.1@2.1@6151421@SOLUTION FOR INJECTION (2 ML)@EURO@@@@@@@@5@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism.

In postmenopausal women, oestrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens - primarily androstenedione and testosterone - to oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2). The suppression of oestrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Letrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the haem of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of oestrogen biosynthesis in all tissues.@@14917868@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive invasive early breast cancer.

The drug may act by mitotic inhibition, causing an arrest of cell division in metaphase. The drug is relatively marrow-sparing and is thus suitable for use in combination with other cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Vincristine is poorly absorbed orally. The clearance of the drug after rapid intravenous injection follows a triphasic decay pattern: a very rapid steep descent (alpha phase); a narrow-middle region (beta-phase) and a much longer terminal region (gamma phase). The terminal phase half-life of the drug varies from 15-155 hours. Dosing with the drug more frequently than once weekly is therefore probably unnecessary. Vincristine is primarily excreted by the biliary route. Patients with impaired hepatic or biliary function, as evidenced by a raised serum alkaline phosphatase, have been shown to have a significantly prolonged vincristine elimination half-life.@@14922036@Vincristine sulphate is used either alone or in conjunction with other oncolytic drugs for the treatment of:  1. Leukaemias, including acute lymphocytic leukaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, acute myelogenous leukaemia and blastic crisis of chronic myelogenous leukaemia 2. Malignant lymphomas, including Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.  3. Multiple myeloma.  4. Solid tumours, including breast carcinoma, small cell bronchogenic carcinoma, head and neck carcinoma and soft tissue sarcomas.  5. Paediatric solid tumours, including Ewing's sarcoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumour, retinoblastoma and medulloblastoma. 6. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Patients with true ITP refractory to splenectomy and short-term treatment with adrenocortical steroids may respond to vincristine but the medicinal product is not recommended as primary treatment of this disorder. Recommended weekly doses of vincristine given for 3 to 4 weeks have produced permanent remissions in some patients. If patients fail to respond after 3 to 6 doses, it is unlikely that there will be any beneficial results with additional doses.@@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@REIMBURSEMENT RANGES FROM 100% TO 70% DEPENDING ON SUB-POPULATIONS@Acquired via takeover of Mayne@@@@The drug is administered intravenously at weekly intervals. The usual dose of vincristine injection for children is 2 mg/m². For children weighing 10 kg or less, the starting dose should be 0.05 mg/kg, administered once a week. The usual dose of vincristine sulfate injection for adults is 1.4 mg/m². A 50% reduction in the dose of vincristine sulfate injection is recommended for patients having a direct serum bilirubin value above 3 mg/100 mL.@@@@@@@This preparation should be administered by individuals experienced in the administration of vincristine sulfate injection. It is extremely important that the intravenous needle or catheter be properly positioned before any vincristine is injected. Leakage into surrounding tissues during intravenous administration of vincristine sulfate injection may cause considerable irritation. If extravasation occurs, the injection should be discontinued immediately, and any remaining portion of the dose should then be introduced into another vein. Local injection of hyaluronidase and the application of moderate heat to the area of leakage help disperse the drug and are thought to minimize discomfort and the possibility of cellulitis.

Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38.

The binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some but not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance gene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental antitumour activity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours.@@14923692@Breast Cancer: Taxotere is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14919534@• Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity: Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia • Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer or multiple myeloma • Paget's disease of bone.@@NO@4-May@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Via takeover of generics unit of Merck KGaA@@@382@Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in multiple myeloma - The recommended dose is 90 mg every 4 weeks.

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects. The differences in potencies for carboplatin and cisplatin appear to be directly related to the difference in aquation rates.@@14919999@It is indicated for the initial treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma in established combination with other approved chemotherapeutics such as Paraplatin and cyclophosphamide.

In combination with cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2 IV on day 1 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles) for previously untreated patients, 300mg/m2 IV on day every 4 weeks for 6 cycles should be used. Suggested dose adjustments include 125% from prior course if platelet and neutrophil counts are above 100,000 and 2,000 respectively; no adjustment if the counts are 50-100,000 or 500-2,000 respectively; and 75% if they are under 50,000 and 500 respectively.@@@@@@@Bone marrow suppression (leukopaenia, neutropaenia, and thrombocytopaenia) is dose-dependent and is also the dose-limiting toxicity. Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents.

Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses. Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: indicated in the management of selected adults with severe, active, rheumatoid arthritis (ARC criteria), or children with active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate.

Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions.Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@N/A@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HARVARD DRUG GROUP@@@@@HARVARD DRUG GROUP||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@100@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@INJECTION@US$@@@@@@@@2.5@MG@2.5 MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

It is a peptide and therefore unrelated to the steroids. Chronic administration results in an inhibition of gonadotrophin production and subsequent suppression of ovarian and testicular steroid secretion. This effect is reversible on discontinuation of therapy.

For the last 25 years, L-asparaginase has been an important component in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). While normal cells can produce asparagine, leukemic cells are unable to produce enough asparagine to survive on their own.  L-asparaginase is given to ALL patients to ensure depletion  of asparagine that is circulating in the blood.2 Depletion (starving the leukemic cells) of asparagine ultimately results in leukemic cell death.  Oncaspar allows patients to gain the full benefits of asparaginase therapy with enhanced patient convenience over native L-asparaginase (nonpegylated form). Through the process of pegylation, the half-life of L-asparaginase is significantly increased 1,2,4  and the L-asparaginase activity is sustained.@@16827346@Indicated as a component of antineoplastic combination therapy in acute lymphoblasticleukaemia (ALL) in paediatric patients from birth to 18 years, and adult patients.@@YES@2017-05-04T00:00:00@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@FIRST-LINE@@118@The recommended dose is 2,500 IU/m2 intramuscularly (1M) or intravenously (IV).

In some severe chronic neutropenia patients filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and basophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia already prior to treatment. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dosedependent at recommended doses. Neutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function.

Appropriate management of the therapy and its complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. Patients should be informed not only of the benefits of therapy but also that they will probably experience adverse reactions. Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately. Psychiatric intervention and/or drug discontinuation should be considered in such cases. Ophthalmologic: As with other interferons, retinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis and optic neuropathy which may result in loss of vision, have been reported after treatment with Roferon-A.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919574@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma. When administered intravesically, epirubicin has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of • Papillary transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder • Carcinoma-in-situ • Prophylaxis of recurrences after transurethral resection.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@FIRST-LINE@@565@High dose: Epirubicin as a single agent for the high dose treatment of lung cancer should be administered according to the following regimens: • Small cell lung cancer (previously untreated): 120 mg/m2 day 1, every 3 weeks. • Non-small cell lung cancer (squamous, large cell, and adenocarcinoma previously untreated): 135 mg/m2 day 1 or 45 mg/m2 day 1, 2 and 3 every 3 weeks. For high dose treatment, epirubicin may be given as an intravenous bolus over 3-5 minutes or as an infusion of up to 30 minutes duration. Breast Cancer: In the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer patients with positive lymph nodes, intravenous doses of epirubicin ranging from 100 mg/m2 (as a single dose on day 1) to 120 mg/m2 (in two divided doses on days 1 and 8) every 3-4 weeks, in combination with intravenous cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil and oral tamoxifen, are recommended. Lower doses (60-75 mg/m2 for conventional treatment and 105-120 mg/m2 for high dose treatment) are recommended for patients whose bone marrow function has been impaired by previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, by age, or neoplastic bone marrow infiltration.

Trabectedin must not be used in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min (see section 4.2). Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia Grades 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia associated with trabectedin therapy have been very commonly reported. A full blood cell count including differential and platelet count must be performed at baseline, weekly for the first two cycles and then once between cycles.

Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38.

In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumor cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues.

Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38.

Among 112 patients evaluable for safety on the mitoxantrone + hydrocortisone arm of the CALGB trial, 18 patients (19%) had a reduction in cardiac function, 5 patients (5%) had cardiac ischemia, and 2 patients (2%) experienced pulmonary edema.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919787@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

In post-menopausal women, oestrogens are produced primarily from the conversion of androgens into oestrogens through the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Oestrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for hormone dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, Aromasin p.o. significantly lowered serum oestrogen concentrations starting from a 5 mg dose, reaching maximal suppression (>90%) with a dose of 10-25 mg. In postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with the 25 mg daily dose, whole body aromatization was reduced by 98%. Exemestane does not possess any progestogenic or oestrogenic activity. A slight androgenic activity, probably due to the 17-hydro derivative, has been observed mainly at high doses. In multiple daily doses trials, Aromasin had no detectable effects on adrenal biosynthesis of cortisol or aldosterone, measured before or after ACTH challenge, thus demonstrating its selectivity with regard to the other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway. Glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid replacements are therefore not needed. A non dose-dependent slight increase in serum LH and FSH levels has been observed even at low doses: this effect is, however, expected for the pharmacological class and is probably the result of feedback at the pituitary level due to the reduction in oestrogen levels that stimulate the pituitary secretion of gonadotropins also in postmenopausal women.@@14916965@Adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogenreceptor positive early breast cancer who have received two to three years of tamoxifen and are switched to Aromasin for completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy; the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy.@@-@-@@NICE: for unplanned swtich therapy 45% likely to be £20,000 per QALY and 80% to be £30,000@@@@100%@-@SECOND-LINE@-@769@The recommended dose of Aromasin in early and advanced breast cancer is one 25 mg tablet once daily after a meal.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer. Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs (PDGFR, RET, or KIT) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRß- and VEGFR2-dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo.@@14923305@Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor GIST: indicated for the treatment of GIST after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919572@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

For high dose treatment, epirubicin may be given as an intravenous bolus over 3-5 minutes or as an infusion of up to 30 minutes duration. Breast Cancer: In the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer patients with positive lymph nodes, intravenous doses of epirubicin ranging from 100 mg/m2 (as a single dose on day 1) to 120 mg/m2 (in two divided doses on days 1 and 8) every 3-4 weeks, in combination with intravenous cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil and oral tamoxifen, are recommended.

The chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant activity of cyclophosphamide is thought to be mediated by the cytotoxic intermediates produced by activation by mixed function oxidases in hepatic microsomes. Non-enzymatic cleavage, possibly taking place in the tumour cells, results in the formulation of highly cytotoxic forms of the drug.@@14917215@Although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to Cytoxan treatment: 1.

Multiple myeloma. 3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (Cytoxan given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration). 4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). 5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). 6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 7. Retinoblastoma. 8. Carcinoma of the breast. Cytoxan is also used in non-malignant disease: it is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid therapy or in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, Cytoxan may induce a remission. Cytoxan is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Roxane is a U.S. subsidiary of Boehringer, acquired by the Germany company in 1978.@@@@Oral Cytoxan dosing is usually in the range of 1 to 5 mg/kg/day for both initial and maintenance dosing. Many other regimens of intravenous and oral Cytoxan have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia. When Cytoxan is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose as well as that of the other drugs. Cytoxan and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of Cytoxan metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.@FDA, May 2000@@@@@@Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoproliferative malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically. Urinary System: Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal. Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Cardiac Toxicity: Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium. No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Infections: Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients.

In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@11.32@25.3@12.38@@@@@@@@@@0.08@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@1.13@1.13@4946642@TABLET@EURO@@@@@@@@15@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects. The differences in potencies for carboplatin and cisplatin appear to be directly related to the difference in aquation rates.@@14920038@It is indicated for the initial treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma in established combination with other approved chemotherapeutics such as Paraplatin and cyclophosphamide.

In combination with cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2 IV on day 1 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles) for previously untreated patients, 300mg/m2 IV on day every 4 weeks for 6 cycles should be used.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered. Since anaemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents.

Because severe gastrointestinal and haematological disturbances can occur an extremely careful benefit-risk analysis has to be made before every course of therapy with dacarbazine.@Jan-96@@@-@@@Haemopoietic depression is the most common toxic side effect of dacarbazine and involves primarily the leucocytes and platelets, although mild anaemia may sometimes occur. Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia may be severe enough to cause death. Possible bone marrow depression requires careful monitoring of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelet levels. Such toxicity may necessitate temporary suspension or cessation of therapy. Hepatic toxicity, accompanied by hepatic vein thrombosis and hepatocellular necrosis resulting in death, have been reported. The incidence of such reactions has been low. This toxicity has been observed mostly when dacarbazine has been administered concomitantly with other anti-neoplastic drugs; however, it has also been reported in some patients treated with dacarbazine alone. Therefore frequent monitoring of liver size, function and blood counts (especially eosinophils) is required. It is recommended that dacarbazine be administered by physicians experienced in the use of cytotoxic therapy. Laboratory facilities should be available for blood monitoring. The drug can produce severe and possibly fatal, haematologic or hepatic toxicity and severe GI reactions and should be administered to patients preferably within the hospital setting, where they can be observed frequently during and after therapy, particulary with regards to the haemopoietic toxicity.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@-@-@@@-@DISCONTINUED@@100%; no NICE review@NHS@NO LABELLED TRIAL@-@@@@-@DACARBAZINE@@@@@DACARBAZINE||||@HOSPIRA@@@@@HOSPIRA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Sarcoma@@@@@Sarcoma|||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@-@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@-@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@@@@1@1.5665@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@12/29/2014@@@4.60E+15@INJECTION POWDER FOR RECONSTITUTION@GB£@@@@@@@@200@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@243@United Kingdom@@@@@@@@

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro.

Dosage recommendations may be converted from those in terms of bodyweight to those related to surface area by means of nomograms, as presented in Documenta Geigy. 1) Remission induction: a) Continuous treatment: i) Rapid injection  2 mg/kg/day is a judicious starting dose. Administer for 10 days. Obtain daily blood counts. If no antileukaemic effect is noted and there is no apparent toxicity, increase to 4 mg/kg/day and maintain until therapeutic response or toxicity is evident. Almost all patients can be carried to toxicity with these doses. ii) 0.5  1.0 mg/kg/day may be given in an infusion of up to 24 hours duration. Results from onehour infusions have been satisfactory in the majority of patients. After 10 days this initial daily dose may be increased to 2 mg/kg/day subject to toxicity. Continue to toxicity or until remission occurs. b) Intermittent treatment: 3-5 mg/kg/day are administered intravenously on each of five consecutive days. After a two to nineday rest period, a further course is given. Continue until response or toxicity occurs. The first evidence of marrow improvement has been reported to occur 7  64 days (mean 28 days) after the beginning of therapy. In general, if a patient shows neither toxicity nor remission after a fair trial, the cautious administration of higher doses is warranted. As a rule, patients have been seen to tolerate higher doses when given by rapid intravenous injection as compared with slow infusion. This difference is due to the rapid metabolism of Cytarabine and the consequent short duration of action of the high dose. 2) Maintenance therapy: Remissions which have been induced by Cytarabine, or by other drugs, may be maintained by intravenous or subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg once or twice weekly.@EMA, June 1999@@@@@@Only physicians experienced in cancer chemotherapy should use Cytarabine for Injection USP.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14922043@Indicated for the management of nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and for the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV).@@YES@@@NO REVIEW@@@@100%@@@@@Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated With Highly Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy: The recommended adult oral dosage is 24 mg given as three 8-mg tablets administered 30 minutes before the start of single-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2.

The effects of perifosine on Akt are of particular interest because of the importance of this pathway in the development of most cancers, the evidence that it is often activated in tumors that are resistant to other forms of anticancer therapy, and the difficulty encountered thus far in the discovery of drugs that will inhibit this pathway without causing excessive toxicity. High levels of activated Akt (pAkt) are seen frequently in many types of cancer and have been correlated with poor prognosis in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma, gastric, hepatocellular, endometrial, prostate, renal cell, head and neck cancers and hematological malignancies, as well as glioblastoma. The majority of tumors expressing high levels of pAkt were high-grade, advanced stage or had other features associated with poor prognosis. High pAkt is often seen in tumors that are resistant to conventional cancer treatments, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and especially therapy with some of the newer biologicals.

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14920878@Methotrexate is used in the treatment of adults with severe, active, classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis who are unresponsive or intolerant to conventional therapy. Methotrexate has also been used in the treatment of severe, uncontrolled psoriasis, which is not responsive to other therapy. Methotrexate has been used to produce regression in a wide range of neoplastic conditions including acute leukaemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue and osteogenic sarcomas, and solid tumours particularly breast, lung, head and neck, bladder, cervical, ovarian, and testicular carcinoma.@@NO@Jan-91@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Eisai acquired French-based Biodim.

The data were derived from the pivotal 320 patient, Phase III trial for Ceplene, which met its primary endpoint of increased LFS (p less than 0.01) among AML patients in their first remission. By performing a weighted linear regression analysis between estimates of LFS and OS at specific time points and between the estimated effects of Ceplene with IL-2 on LFS and OS, researchers found a high correlation between the country-specific Kaplan-Meier estimates of 24-month LFS and 36-month OS in both treated and untreated groups (R(2) = 0.71; P=0.0002). Similar correlations were also found between 24-month LFS and 48-month and 60-month OS. In addition, country-specific hazard ratios demonstrated that the treatment effect of Ceplene with IL-2 on LFS and OS were found to be highly correlated (R(2) = 0.84; P=0.004). [EpiCept/EHA, 12 June 2008]        ASH December 2007; the median leukaemia-free survival (LFS) of AML patients in first remission was 15 months for the Ceplene + IL-2 group versus 9.7 months in the control group (P=0.025). A Kaplan-Meier five-year estimate was supportive of the effect of Ceplene + IL-2 in maintaining LFS. In the AML population in first remission, this effect was shown in 34% of the treatment group versus 22 percent of the control group (P=0.024). Further, the median duration of the overall survival rate in the first remission patient group was 44 months for the Ceplene + IL-2 group versus 29 months for the control group, an improvement of 15 months. The Kaplan-Meier estimate analysis of patients alive at five years show a strong trend in favor of Ceplene + IL-2 (Kaplan-Meier, P=0.07), even though the trial was not initially powered to demonstrate a benefit in overall survival.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors.

The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro.

Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately. Psychiatric intervention and/or drug discontinuation should be considered in such cases. Ophthalmologic: As with other interferons, retinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis and optic neuropathy which may result in loss of vision, have been reported after treatment with Roferon-A.

In some patients higher dosages may be temporarily required to control the disease. Once the disease is under control the dosage should be reduced or tapered off to the lowest suitable level under continuous monitoring and observation of the patient. For a short dexamethasone suppression test, 1mg dexamethasone is given at 11 p.m. and plasma cortisol measured the next morning. Patients who do not show a decrease in cortisol can be exposed to a longer test: 500 micrograms dexamethasone is given at 6 hourly intervals for 48 hours followed by 2mg every 6 hours for a further 48 hours. 24 hour-urine collections are made before, during and at the end of the test for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids.

Frequent patient review is required to appropriately titrate the dose against disease activity.

Elevations of neutrophil counts are dosedependent at recommended doses. Neutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. Following termination of filgrastim therapy, circulating neutrophil counts decrease by 50% within 1 to 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 to 7 days.@@14921900@To decrease the incidence of infection‚ as manifested by febrile neutropaenia‚ in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a significant incidence of severe neutropaenia with fever; reducing the time to neutrophil recovery and the duration of fever, following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment of adults with AML; to reduce the duration of neutropaenia and neutropaenia-related clinical sequelae‚ eg‚ febrile neutropaenia‚ in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by marrow transplantation; the mobilisation of haematopoietic progenitor cells into the peripheral blood for collection by leukapheresis.

The p53 gene is one of the most potent members of a group of naturally-occurring tumor suppressors, which act to kill cancer cells, arrest cancer cell growth and protect cells from becoming cancerous. Introgen's clinical trial strategy for Advexin is to test it in a variety of life-threatening cancers for which there are no effective treatments.

In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917825@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

For high dose treatment, epirubicin may be given as an intravenous bolus over 3-5 minutes or as an infusion of up to 30 minutes duration. Breast Cancer: In the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer patients with positive lymph nodes, intravenous doses of epirubicin ranging from 100 mg/m2 (as a single dose on day 1) to 120 mg/m2 (in two divided doses on days 1 and 8) every 3-4 weeks, in combination with intravenous cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil and oral tamoxifen, are recommended.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917501@A component of adjuvant therapy in patients with evidence of axillary node tumor involvement following resection of primary breast cancer.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@No tiering.

[Oncolytics]@@-@-@-@CALGARY, CANADA@@@Reolysin, a proprietary formulation of the human reovirus, has been demonstrated to replicate specifically in tumour cells bearing an activated Ras pathway. Activating mutations of Ras and upstream elements of Ras may play a role in greater than two thirds of all human cancers. Reolysin may represent a novel treatment for Ras activated tumour cells and some cellular proliferative disorders. Reovirus, an acronym for Respiratory Enteric Orphan virus, is generally believed to inhabit the respiratory and bowel systems in humans. Reovirus is found naturally in sewage and water supplies. By age 12, half of all children show evidence of reovirus exposure and by adulthood, most people have been exposed. However, the disease is non-pathogenic, meaning there are typically no symptoms from infections. The link to its cancer-killing ability was established after the reovirus was discovered to reproduce well in various cancer cell lines. Tumours bearing an activated Ras pathway are deficient in their ability to activate the anti-viral response mediated by the host cellular protein, PKR. Since PKR is responsible for preventing reovirus replication, tumour cells lacking the activity of PKR are susceptible to reovirus replication. As normal cells do not possess Ras activations, these cells are able to stop reovirus infection through normal PKR activity. In tumour cells with an activated Ras pathway, reovirus is able to freely replicate and eventually kill the host tumour cells. As cell death occurs, progeny virus particles are then free to infect surrounding cancer cells. This cycle of infection, replication and cell death is believed to be repeated until there are no longer any tumour cells carrying an activated Ras pathway available.@@14924681@Combo with paclitaxel and carboplatin in advanced head and neck cancer@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@-@-@-@14@-@-@@@-@@6/1/2008@-@-@@-@Eligible patients include those with advanced or metastatic head and neck cancers that are refractory to standard therapy or for which no curative standard therapy exists.@@@II@II@@-@-@>> Patient enrolment started in the U.S. [Oncolytics, 8.09.2008]>> Trial started.

Appropriate management of the therapy and its complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. Patients should be informed not only of the benefits of therapy but also that they will probably experience adverse reactions. Hypersensitivity: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Roferon-A or in the combination therapy with ribavirin, treatment has to be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy has to be instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. In transplant patients (e.g., kidney or bone marrow transplant) therapeutic immunosuppression may be weakened because interferons also exert an immunostimulatory action. Infections: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must be ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Roferon-A. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered. Psychiatric: Severe psychiatric adverse reactions may manifest in patients receiving therapy with interferons, including Roferon-A. Depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and suicide may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness. Physicians should monitor all patients treated with Roferon-A for evidence of depression. Physicians should inform patients of the possible development of depression prior to initiation of therapy, and patients should report any sign or symptom of depression immediately. Psychiatric intervention and/or drug discontinuation should be considered in such cases. Ophthalmologic: As with other interferons, retinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis and optic neuropathy which may result in loss of vision, have been reported after treatment with Roferon-A. Any patient complaining of decrease or loss of vision must have an eye examination. Because these ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states, a visual examination prior to initiation of Roferon-A monotherapy or in the combination therapy with ribavirin is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.

In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered.

Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects. Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs.

Compared to other antimetabolites such as 5-Fluorouracil or methotrexate, raltitrexed acts as a direct and specific TS inhibitor. TS is a key enzyme in the de novo synthesis of thymidine triphosphate (TTP), a nucleotide required exclusively for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis. Inhibition of TS leads to DNA fragmentation and cell death. Raltitrexed is transported into cells via a reduced folate carrier (RFC) and is then extensively polyglutamated by the enzyme folyl polyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) to polyglutamate forms that are retained in cells and are even more potent inhibitors of TS. Raltitrexed polyglutamation enhances TS inhibitory potency and increases the duration of TS inhibition in cells which may improve antitumour activity.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that exposure of CLL lymphocytes to 2F-ara-A triggers extensive DNA fragmentation and cell death characteristic of apoptosis.@@14917907@Treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in patients with sufficient bone marrow reserves.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14919565@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Cytosar-U may be given by intravenous infusion or injection, subcutaneously, or intrathecally. Patients can tolerate higher total doses when they receive the drug by rapid intravenous injection as compared with slow infusion. This phenomenon is related to the drug's rapid inactivation and brief exposure of susceptible normal and neoplastic cells to significant levels after rapid injection. Normal and neoplastic cells seem to respond in somewhat parallel fashion to these different modes of administration and no clear-cut clinical advantage has been demonstrated for either. In the induction therapy of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, the usual cytarabine dose in combination with other anti-cancer drugs is 100 mg/m²/day by continuous IV infusion (Days 1-7) or 100 mg/m² IV every 12 hours (Days 1-7). Cytosar-U has been used intrathecally in acute leukemia in doses ranging from 5 mg/m² to 75 mg/m² of body surface area. The frequency of administration varied from once a day for 4 days to once every 4 days. The most frequently used dose was 30 mg/m² every 4 days until cerebrospinal fluid findings were normal, followed by one additional treatment. The dosage schedule is usually governed by the type and severity of central nervous system manifestations and the response to previous therapy.@@@@@@@Only physicians experienced in cancer chemotherapy should use Cytarabine for Injection USP.

In preclinical studies, DAST has proved to be effective in various tumor models, including pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, and breast cancer. Currently, two phase I clinical studies are being conducted with DAST. The first provisional data from these studies are very promising.@@15358220@Treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy, and, if KRAS wild type, an anti-EGFR therapy.@Both@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@THIRD-LINE@NCT01271712@199@The recommended dose is 160 mg regorafenib (four 40 mg tablets) taken orally once daily for the first 21 days of each 28 day cycle.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@MIBE@@@@@MIBE||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@FENTADOLON@@@@@FENTADOLON||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@21.07@37.62@22.43@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@4.21@4.21@1914446@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MCG@25 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies.

Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate.

Frequent patient review is required to appropriately titrate the dose against disease activity. Adrenal cortical atrophy develops during prolonged therapy and may persist for years after stopping treatment.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918333@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@1 A PHARMA@@@@@1 A PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@48@71.67@50.21@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@4.8@4.8@682784@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@25@MCG@25 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Little or no binding was observed in the non-lymphoid tissues examined.@@16749502@In combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL.@Both@YES@22-Dec-11@12/22/2011@NO REVIEW@@@@@@FIRST-LINE@NCT00281918@817@The recommended dosage of MabThera in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated and relapsed/refractory patients is 375 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 0 of the first treatment cycle followed by 500 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 1 of each subsequent cycle for 6 cycles in total.

The compound has a high lipophilicity which results in an increased rate of cellular uptake compared with doxorubicin and daunorubicin. Idarubicin has been shown to have a higher potency with respect to daunorubicin and to be an effective agent against murine leukaemia and lymphomas both by i.v. and oral routes. Studies in-vitro on human and murine anthracycline-resistant cells have shown a lower degree of cross-resistance for idarubicin compared with doxorubicin and daunorubicin. Cardiotoxicity studies in animals have indicated that idarubicin has a better therapeutic index than daunorubicin and doxorubicin. The main metabolite, idarubicinol, has shown in-vitro and in-vivo antitumoral activity in experimental models. In the rat, idarubicinol, administered at the same doses as the parent drug, is clearly less cardiotoxic than idarubicin.@@14920062@Idamycin in combination with other approved antileukemic drugs is indicated for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in adults.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@FIRST-LINE@@230@Idamycin 12 mg/m2 daily for 3 days by slow (10 to 15 min) intravenous injection in combination with cytarabine.

Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@N/A@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@BEDFORD LABORATORIES@@@@@BEDFORD LABORATORIES||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@10@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@55390-0033-10@INJECTION@US$@@@@@@@@200@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

The dose-dependent cardiotoxicity observed during anthracycline administration is due to anthracycline-induced iron-dependent free radical oxidative stress on the relatively unprotected cardiac muscle. Dexrazoxane, an analogue of EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid), is hydrolysed in cardiac cells to the ring-opened product ICRF-198. Both dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) and ICRF-198 are capable of chelating metal ions. It is generally thought that they can provide cardioprotection by scavenging metal ions thus preventing the Fe3+-anthracycline complex from redox cycling and forming reactive radicals.@@14920052@Indicated for reducing the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy associated with doxorubicin administration in women with metastatic breast cancer who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 and who will continue to receive doxorubicin therapy to maintain tumor control.

In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance values < 40 mL/min), the recommended dosage ratio of Zinecard:doxorubicin is 5:1 (eg. 250 mg/m2 Zinecard:50 mg/m2 doxorubicin).@@@@@@@Zinecard may add to the myelosuppression caused by chemotherapeutic agents. There is some evidence that the use of dexrazoxane concurrently with the initiation of fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FAC) therapy interferes with the antitumor efficacy of the regimen, and this use is not recommended. In the largest of three breast cancer trials, patients who received dexrazoxane starting with their first cycle of FAC therapy had a lower response rate (48% vs 63%; p=0.007) and shorter time to progression than patients who did not receive dexrazoxane. Therefore, Zinecard should only be used in those patients who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 and are continuing with doxorubicin therapy. Although clinical studies have shown that patients receiving FAC with Zinecard may receive a higher cumulative dose of doxorubicin before experiencing cardiac toxicity than patients receiving FAC without Zinecard the use of Zinecard in patients who have already received a cumulative dose of doxorubicin of 300 mg/m2 without Zinecard, does not eliminate the potential for anthracycline induced cardiac toxicity. Therefore, cardiac function should be carefully monitored. Secondary malignancies (primarily acute myeloid leukemia) have been reported in patients treated chronically with oral razoxane. Razoxane is the racemic mixture, of which dexrazoxane is the S(+)-enantiomer. In these patients, the total cumulative dose of razoxane ranged from 26 to 480 grams and the duration of treatment was from 42 to 319 weeks. One case of T-cell lymphoma, a case of B-cell lymphoma and six to eight cases of cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma have also been reported in patients treated with razoxane.@LABEL@No@@@@@III@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@The difference in decline from baseline in LVEF was evident beginning with a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m2 and reached statistical significance in patients who received =400 mg/m2 of doxorubicin.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@RESTRICTED SUBSTANCE PRESCRIPTION@SNS@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@JOHNSON & JOHNSON@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@JOHNSON & JOHNSON|JANSSEN CILAG|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@DUROGESIC MATRIX@@@@@DUROGESIC MATRIX||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1807@28.11@43.88@30.4@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/23/2017@5.62@5.62@848119@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@75@MCG@75 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@217@Spain@@@@@@@@

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14920252@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses.

Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate.

Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@N/A@@@-@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@-@-@@@-@APPROVED@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@-@@@@-@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@WYETH@PFIZER@@@@WYETH|PFIZER|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@-@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@-@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1.1229@142.83@235.72@149.26@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@6/7/2017@142.83@142.83@19888078@INJECTABLE PREPARATION, 50 ML@EURO@@@@@@@@5@G@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@119@Italy@@@@@@@@

Bone marrow suppression, notably thrombocytopaenia and leukopaenia, which may contribute to bleeding and overwhelming infections in an already compromised patient, is the most common and severe of the toxic effects of BiCNU. Since the major toxicity is delayed bone marrow suppression, blood counts should be monitored weekly for at least 6 weeks after a dose. At the recommended dosage, courses of BiCNU should not be given more frequently than every 6 weeks. The bone marrow toxicity of BiCNU is cumulative and therefore dosage adjustment must be considered on the basis of nadir blood counts from prior dose. Pulmonary toxicity from BiCNU appears to be dose related. Patients receiving greater than 1400 mg/m2 cumulative dose are at significantly higher risk than those receiving less.

If well tolerated, treatment may continue until disease progression. The capsule(s) must be swallowed whole, and must not be chewed crushed or divided. Topotecan capsules may be taken with or without food. Prior to administration of the first course of topotecan, patients must have a baseline neutrophil count of = 1.5 x 109/l, and a platelet count of = 100 x 109/l.

Patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.5 x 109/l) for 7 days or more, or severe neutropenia associated with fever or infection, or who have had treatment delayed due to neutropenia, should be given a dose reduced by 0.4 mg/m2/day i.e. 1.9 mg/m2/day (or subsequently down to 1.5 mg/m2/day if necessary).

As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan can cause severe myelosuppression. Myelosuppression leading to sepsis and fatalities due to sepsis have been reported in patients treated with topotecan. Topotecan-induced neutropenia can cause neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have been reported in clinical trials with topotecan. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, the possibility of neutropenic colitis should be considered. Topotecan and topotecan in combination with cisplatin are commonly associated with clinically relevant thrombocytopenia. This should be taken into account, e.g. in case patients at increased risk of tumour bleeds are considered for therapy. As expected, patients with poor performance status (PS>1) have a lower response rate and an increased incidence of complications such as fever, infection and sepsis.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@ABZ PHARMA@@@@@ABZ PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@65.38@93.65@68.14@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@6.54@6.54@2239739@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@50@MCG@50 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

14918614@Onco@@@@@300f1020ntsdm@@@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@L01CD01@L01C@YES@MADISON, NEW JERSEY@@@Methotrexate is an antimetabolite which acts principally by competitively inhibiting the enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase. In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14918614@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses. Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: indicated in the management of selected adults with severe, active, rheumatoid arthritis (ARC criteria), or children with active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate. Combined use of methotrexate with gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or cytotoxic agents, has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects. Rest and physiotherapy as indicated should be continued.@@YES@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Pfizer acquired Wyeth on 26 January 2009 in a deal worth U.S $68 billion [Pfizer 26.01.2009]@-@-@-@Leukemia: When used for induction, methotrexate in doses of 3.3 mg/m2 in combination with 60 mg/m2 of prednisone, given daily, produced remissions in 50% of patients treated, usually within a period of 4 to 6 weeks. Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@N/A@@@-@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@-@-@@@-@APPROVED@@@@NO LABELLED TRIAL@-@@@@-@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@WYETH@PFIZER@@@@WYETH|PFIZER|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@-@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@-@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1.1229@760.12@1254.5@794.33@@@@@@@@@@2.53@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@6/7/2017@760.12@760.12@37112036@CONCENTRATE FOR SOLUTION FOR INFUSION (VIAL), 50 ML@EURO@@@@@@@@300@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@119@Italy@@@@@@@@

Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38.

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that exposure of CLL lymphocytes to 2F-ara-A triggers extensive DNA fragmentation and cell death characteristic of apoptosis.@@14917929@Treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in patients with sufficient bone marrow reserves.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration.

Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Little or no binding was observed in the non-lymphoid tissues examined.@@14924692@Rituxan with Apo2L/TRAIL@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@">> Roche reaches a friendly agreement to purchase the latter's outstanding shares at a price of US$95 per share.

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14919145@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses. Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: indicated in the management of selected adults with severe, active, rheumatoid arthritis (ARC criteria), or children with active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate. Combined use of methotrexate with gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or cytotoxic agents, has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects. Rest and physiotherapy as indicated should be continued.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Via Mayne@@@@Leukemia: When used for induction, methotrexate in doses of 3.3 mg/m2 in combination with 60 mg/m2 of prednisone, given daily, produced remissions in 50% of patients treated, usually within a period of 4 to 6 weeks. Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@N/A@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HOSPIRA@@@@@HOSPIRA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1@36.19@@@@@@@@@@@@0.04@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/2/2017@36.19@36.19@61703-0408-41@INJECTION@US$@@@@@@@@1000@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Little or no binding was observed in the non-lymphoid tissues examined.@@16749494@In combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL.@Both@YES@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@FIRST-LINE@NCT00281918@817@The recommended dosage of MabThera in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated and relapsed/refractory patients is 375 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 0 of the first treatment cycle followed by 500 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 1 of each subsequent cycle for 6 cycles in total.

A primary growth factor for erythroid development, erythropoietin is produced in the kidney and released into the bloodstream in response to hypoxia. In responding to hypoxia, erythropoietin interacts with progenitor stem cells to increase red blood cell (RBC) production. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is impaired in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), and erythropoietin deficiency is the primary cause of their anemia.

The associated ICERs for the two scenarios were approximately £160,000 and £24,000 per additional QALY gained, respectively.  In the base case of the Assessment Group's economic analysis, survival was assumed to be the same for both treatment and control arms (that is, a HR of 1 was used).

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14920121@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: Aredia, in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with Aredia. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Paget's Disease Aredia is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of Aredia was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase =3 times the upper limit of normal.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14919530@• Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity: Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia • Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer or multiple myeloma • Paget's disease of bone.@@NO@6-Aug@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@382@Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in multiple myeloma - The recommended dose is 90 mg every 4 weeks.

All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@RIEMSER ARZNEIMITTEL@@@@@RIEMSER ARZNEIMITTEL||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@PATCH, TRANSDERMAL@EURO@@@@@@@@50@MCG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14917814@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@ACTAVIS@@@@@ACTAVIS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@60.12@87@62.72@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@12.02@12.02@4683071@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@100@MCG@100 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

The ability of Ethyol to differentially protect normal tissues is attributed to the higher capillary alkaline phosphatase activity, higher pH and better vascularity of normal tissues relative to tumor tissue, which results in a more rapid generation of the active thiol metabolite as well as a higher rate constant for uptake into cells. The higher concentration of the thiol metabolite in normal tissues is available to bind to, and thereby detoxify, reactive metabolites of cisplatin.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14917878@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@MIBE@@@@@MIBE||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@FENTADOLON@@@@@FENTADOLON||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@10@1.1511@119.4@161.94@123.86@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@11.94@11.94@1914512@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@75@MCG@MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.

Most patients with NET are not diagnosed until their disease has advanced, meaning the cancer has spread to other parts of the body and has become more difficult to treat[5]. Patients with advanced NET usually have a five year survival rate of less than 35%[6].Results from the Phase III RADIANT-3 trial show that everolimus more than doubled median time without tumor growth from 4.6 to 11.0 months when compared with placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET (hazard ratio=0.35 [95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.45]; p<0.0001)[7].

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects.

Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFRß), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays. Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs (PDGFRß, VEGFR2, KIT) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and/or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

It also possesses marked immunosuppressant properties. The principal site of cyclophosphamide activation is the liver. The chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant activity of cyclophosphamide is thought to be mediated by the cytotoxic intermediates produced by activation by mixed function oxidases in hepatic microsomes. Non-enzymatic cleavage, possibly taking place in the tumour cells, results in the formulation of highly cytotoxic forms of the drug.@@14916978@Although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to Cytoxan treatment: 1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma. 2. Multiple myeloma. 3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (Cytoxan given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration). 4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). 5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). 6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. 7. Retinoblastoma. 8. Carcinoma of the breast. Cytoxan is also used in non-malignant disease: it is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid therapy or in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, Cytoxan may induce a remission. Cytoxan is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Oral Cytoxan dosing is usually in the range of 1 to 5 mg/kg/day for both initial and maintenance dosing. Many other regimens of intravenous and oral Cytoxan have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia. When Cytoxan is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose as well as that of the other drugs. Cytoxan and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of Cytoxan metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.@FDA, 29 April 1987@4/29/1987@@@@@Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoproliferative malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically. Urinary System: Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal. Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Cardiac Toxicity: Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium. No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Infections: Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@2000@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE@@@@@CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE||||@BMS@@@@@BMS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia@Acute Myeloid Leukaemia@Hodgkin's Lymphoma@Myeloma@Haematological Malignancy|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia|Acute Myeloid Leukaemia|Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Myeloma|||||@CYTOXAN@@@@@CYTOXAN||||@Alkylating Agent@@@@@Alkylating Agent||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@100@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@00015-0504-01@TABLET@US$@@@@@@@@25@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

The incidence ofgastrointestinal perforation in NSCLC patients receiving Avastin was 0.9% compared to 0% in patients receiving only chemotherapy.  Wound Healing Complications: The incidence of post-operative wound healing and/or bleeding complications was increased in patients with mCRC receiving Avastin as compared to patients receiving only chemotherapy. Among patientsrequiring surgery on or within 60 days of receiving study treatment, wound healing and/or bleeding complications occurred in 15% (6/39) of patients receiving bolus-IFL plus Avastin as compared to 4% (1/25) of patients who received bolus-IFL alone. In the same study, the incidence of wound dehiscence was also higher in the Avastin-treatedpatients (1% vs. 0.5%).   Hemorrhage: Severe or fatal hemorrhages, including hemoptysis, gastrointestinalbleeding, hematemesis, CNS hemorrhage, epistaxis, and vaginal bleeding occurred up to five-fold more frequently in Avastin-treated patients compared to patients treated with chemotherapy alone. NCI-CTC Grade 3-5 hemorrhagic events occurred in 4.7% of NSCLC patients and 5.2% of mCRC patients receiving Avastin compared to 1.1% and 0.7% for the control groups respectively. The incidence of epistaxis was higher (35% vs. 10%) in patients with mCRC receiving bolus-IFL plus Avastin compared with patients receiving bolus-IFL plus placebo. These events were generally mild in severity (NCI-CTC Grade 1) and resolved without medical intervention. Additional mild to moderate hemorrhagic events reported more frequently in patients receiving bolus-IFL plus Avastin when compared to those receiving bolus-IFL plus placebo included gastrointestinal hemorrhage (24% vs. 6%), minor gum bleeding (2% vs. 0), and vaginal hemorrhage (4% vs. 2%).   Arterial Thromboembolic Events: The incidence of arterial thromboembolic events was increased in NSCLC patients receiving PC plus Avastin (3.0%) compared with patients receiving PC alone (1.4%). Five events were fatal in the PC plus Avastin arm, compared with 1 event in the PC alone arm.   Venous Thromboembolic Events: The incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3-4 venous thromboembolic events was higher in patients with mCRC or NSCLC receiving Avastin with chemotherapy as compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919907@1.

Externally delivered radiation has limitations given the difficulty in focusing its energy specifically on remaining tumor cells and its potential to harm nearby sensitive and critical tissues.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.

The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@6-Nov@@@@@APPROVED@@Covered; non-preferred; quantity limit 20 for 30 days@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@JOHNSON & JOHNSON@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@JOHNSON & JOHNSON|JANSSEN CILAG|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@DURAGESIC@@@@@DURAGESIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1@552.64@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/2/2017@110.53@110.53@50458-0093-05@TRANSDERMAL PATCH - 22.5 CM2@US$@@@@@@@@75@MCG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14920245@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses.

Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@N/A@@@-@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@-@-@@@-@APPROVED@@@SSN@NO LABELLED TRIAL@-@@@@-@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@WYETH@PFIZER@@@@WYETH|PFIZER|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@-@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@-@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@4@1.1229@22.15@36.55@23.14@@@@@@@@@@0.55@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@6/7/2017@5.54@5.54@19888128@PREPARATION FOR INJECTION (SYRINGE)@EURO@@@@@@@@10@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@119@Italy@@@@@@@@

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.

In postmenopausal women, estradiol is produced primarily from the conversion of androstenedione to estrone through the aromatase enzyme complex in peripheral tissues. Estrone is subsequently converted to estradiol. Reducing circulating estradiol levels has been shown to produce a beneficial effect in women with breast cancer. In postmenopausal women, Arimidex at a daily dose of 1 mg produced estradiol suppression of greater than 80% using a highly sensitive assay. Arimidex does not possess any progestogenic, androgenic or oestrogenic activity. Daily doses of Arimidex up to 10 mg do not have any effect on cortisol or aldosterone secretion, measured before or after standard ACTH challenge testing.

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14918349@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@ABZ PHARMA@@@@@ABZ PHARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1.1511@32.63@52.24@34.36@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@6.53@6.53@2239722@PATCH (MATRIX)@EURO@@@@@@@@50@MCG@50 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

The study showed that patients treated with Lenvima lived on average 14.7 months longer without their disease progressing than patients treated with placebo.A large proportion of people receiving Lenvima during the studies needed to reduce the dose or interrupt treatment because of side effects (mainly high blood pressure and excess protein in the urine). Overall EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) considered that Lenvima has a safety profile which is consistent with other similar therapies and that side effects were predictable and manageable.

The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@@JANSSEN CILAG||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@DUROGESIC SMAT@@@@@DUROGESIC SMAT||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1807@260.52@340.36@269.42@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/15/2017@13.03@13.03@575019@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@75@MCG@75 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

ABT-869 is not a general antiproliferative agent because, in most cancer cells, >1,000-fold higher concentrations of ABT-869 are required for inhibition of proliferation. However, ABT-869 exhibits potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on cancer cells whose proliferation is dependent on mutant kinases, such as FLT3. In vivo ABT-869 is effective orally in the mechanism-based murine models of VEGF-induced uterine edema (ED50 = 0.5 mg/kg) and corneal angiogenesis (>50% inhibition, 15 mg/kg). In tumor growth studies, ABT-869 exhibits efficacy in human fibrosarcoma and breast, colon, and small cell lung carcinoma xenograft models (ED50 = 1.5–5 mg/kg, twice daily) and is also effective (>50% inhibition) in orthotopic breast and glioma models. Reduction in tumor size and tumor regression was observed in epidermoid carcinoma and leukemia xenograft models, respectively. In combination, ABT-869 produced at least additive effects when given with cytotoxic therapies. @@14918893@-@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@-@Roche announces US$43.7 billion proposal to assume full control of Genentech.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922946@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses. Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: indicated in the management of selected adults with severe, active, rheumatoid arthritis (ARC criteria), or children with active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate. Combined use of methotrexate with gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or cytotoxic agents, has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects. Rest and physiotherapy as indicated should be continued.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Choriocarcinoma and similar trophoblastic diseases: Methotrexate is administered orally or intramuscularly in doses of 15 to 30 mg daily for a five-day course. Such courses are usually repeated for 3 to 5 times as required, with rest periods of one or more weeks interposed between courses, until any manifesting toxic symptoms subside.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@N/A@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@BEDFORD LABORATORIES@@@@@BEDFORD LABORATORIES||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Endometrial Cancer@Breast Cancer@NSCLC@Head & Neck Cancer@@Endometrial Cancer|Breast Cancer|NSCLC|Head & Neck Cancer||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@10@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@55390-0031-10@INJECTION - 2 ML@US$@@@@@@@@50@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.@@14919631@Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin =50 mg/m2; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen; prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@Novartis purchases Hexal and Eon Labs in a 5.65 billion euro deal.

Cytosar-U may be given by intravenous infusion or injection, subcutaneously, or intrathecally. Patients can tolerate higher total doses when they receive the drug by rapid intravenous injection as compared with slow infusion. This phenomenon is related to the drug's rapid inactivation and brief exposure of susceptible normal and neoplastic cells to significant levels after rapid injection. Normal and neoplastic cells seem to respond in somewhat parallel fashion to these different modes of administration and no clear-cut clinical advantage has been demonstrated for either. In the induction therapy of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, the usual cytarabine dose in combination with other anti-cancer drugs is 100 mg/m²/day by continuous IV infusion (Days 1-7) or 100 mg/m² IV every 12 hours (Days 1-7). Cytosar-U has been used intrathecally in acute leukemia in doses ranging from 5 mg/m² to 75 mg/m² of body surface area. The frequency of administration varied from once a day for 4 days to once every 4 days. The most frequently used dose was 30 mg/m² every 4 days until cerebrospinal fluid findings were normal, followed by one additional treatment. The dosage schedule is usually governed by the type and severity of central nervous system manifestations and the response to previous therapy.@@@@@@@Only physicians experienced in cancer chemotherapy should use Cytarabine for Injection USP. For induction therapy, patients should be treated in a facility with laboratory and supportive resources sufficient to monitor drug tolerance and protect and maintain a patient compromised by drug toxicity. The main toxic effect of cytarabine is bone marrow suppression with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Less serious toxicity includes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, oral ulceration, and hepatic dysfunction. The physician must judge possible benefit to the patient against known toxic effects of this drug in considering the advisability of therapy with cytarabine.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14922930@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14919544@• Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity: Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia • Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer or multiple myeloma • Paget's disease of bone.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Via takeover of generics unit of Merck KGaA@@@392@Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia; please see label for dosing ranges; the total dose of pamidronate disodium may be administered either in a single infusion or in multiple infusions over 2-4 consecutive days.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose.

The data for this study should be collected systematically to allow aggregation and analysis at a national level in order to inform the appraisal review. 1.4 For people in chronic-phase CML who are currently receiving interferon alpha (IFN-a) as first-line treatment, the decision about whether to change to imatinib should be informed by the response of the disease to current treatment and by the tolerance of the person to IFN-a.

Most reactions were of mild-to-moderate grade, but drug was discontinued for drug-related adverse reactions in 2.4% of newly diagnosed patients, 4% of patients in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, 4% in accelerated phase and 5% in blast crisis. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse reactions were edema, nausea and vomiting, muscle cramps, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea and rash. Edema was most frequently periorbital or in lower limbs and was managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or by reducing the dose of Gleevec. The frequency of severe superficial edema was 1.5%-6%. The overall safety profile of pediatric patients treated with Gleevec in 93 children studied was similar to that found in studies with adult patients, except that musculoskeletal pain was less frequent (20.5%) and peripheral edema was not reported. Nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported individual adverse reactions with an incidence similar to that seen in adult patients. Although most patients experienced adverse reactions at some time during the study, the incidence of Grade 3/4 adverse reactions was low.@@@@MONO@IMATINIB MESYLATE@@@@@IMATINIB MESYLATE||||@NOVARTIS@@@@@NOVARTIS||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia||||||||@GLIVEC@@@@@GLIVEC||||@TK Inhibitor@bcr-abl@PDGF@SCF@@TK Inhibitor|bcr-abl|PDGF|SCF|@DURATION OF RESPONSE@OVERALL SURVIVAL@@@@@@@@@ACCELERATED PHASE@@@@@INTERNATIONAL@OPEN-LABEL@SINGLE-ARM@@@1@1@67794.30757@@@22.9@month@22.9 month@67794.31@67794.31@97.33@60@1.299@973.32@@@@@@@@@@@@0.16@1@@mg@600@1@@@@@@@@@@@7/28/2017@16.22@16.22@8.09E+15@FILM-COATED TABLET@GB£@@@@@@@@100@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@243@United Kingdom@@@@@@@@

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14920105@Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases.

Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose.

Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration.

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor.

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A which is taken up by cells and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2F-ara-ATP. This metabolite has been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase a/d and e, DNA primase and DNA ligase thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, partial inhibition of RNA polymerase II and consequent reduction in protein synthesis occur. While some aspects of the mechanism of action of 2F-ara-ATP are as yet unclear, it is assumed that effects on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis all contribute to inhibition of cell growth with inhibition of DNA synthesis being the dominant factor. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that exposure of CLL lymphocytes to 2F-ara-A triggers extensive DNA fragmentation and cell death characteristic of apoptosis.@@14917920@Treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in patients with sufficient bone marrow reserves.

Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have been reported in clinical trials with topotecan. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, the possibility of neutropenic colitis should be considered.

[Novartis, 21.02.2005]@@@@Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@1.1511@75.48@106.41@78.55@@@@@@@@@@0.08@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@75.48@75.48@5851286@SOLUTION - INFUSION (40 ML)@EURO@@@@@@@@1000@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.

Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single-agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered.

Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial  dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of Paraplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimise additive effects.

Ibritumomab tiuxetan targets the antigen CD20 which is located on the surface of malignant and normal B-lymphocytes . During B-cell maturation, CD20 is first expressed in the midstage of B-lymphoblast (pre-B-cell), and is lost during the final stage of B-cell maturation to plasma cells. It is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalise on antibody binding. The conjugated antibody has an apparent affinity constant for the CD20 antigen of approximately 17 nM. The binding pattern is very restricted, with no cross-reactivity to other leukocytes or to other types of human tissue. [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin binds specifically to B-cells, including CD20-expressing malignant cells. The isotope yttrium-90 is a pure ß-emitter and has a mean path length of about 5 mm. This results in the ability to kill both targeted and neighbouring cells. Rituximab pre-treatment is necessary to clear circulating B-cells, enabling Zevalin to deliver radiation more specifically to the lymphomas.

This metabolite is believed to be responsible for the reduction of the cumulative renal toxicity of cisplatin and for the reduction of the toxic effects of radiation on normal oral tissues. The ability of Ethyol to differentially protect normal tissues is attributed to the higher capillary alkaline phosphatase activity, higher pH and better vascularity of normal tissues relative to tumor tissue, which results in a more rapid generation of the active thiol metabolite as well as a higher rate constant for uptake into cells. The higher concentration of the thiol metabolite in normal tissues is available to bind to, and thereby detoxify, reactive metabolites of cisplatin.

In postmenopausal women, oestrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens - primarily androstenedione and testosterone - to oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2). The suppression of oestrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Letrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma.

Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HEXAL@NOVARTIS@@@@HEXAL|NOVARTIS|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia@@@@Haematological Malignancy|Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia||||||||@MTX HEXAL@@@@@MTX HEXAL||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1511@377.36@488.09@389.95@@@@@@@@@@0.04@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/1/2017@18.87@18.87@5851375@SOLUTION FOR INFUSION 20 MG@EURO@@@@@@@@500@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

It usually ranges from 0.5-24 mg daily. The duration of therapy is dependent on the clinical response of the patient and as soon as improvement is indicated, the dosage should be adjusted to the minimum required to maintain the desired clinical response. Withdrawal of the drug on completion of therapy should be gradual.@@@@@@@Undesirable effects may be minimised by using the lowest effective dose for the minimum period, and by administering the daily requirement as a single morning dose or whenever possible as a single morning dose on alternative days. Frequent patient review is required to appropriately titrate the dose against disease activity. Adrenal cortical atrophy develops during prolonged therapy and may persist for years after stopping treatment. Withdrawal of corticosteroids after prolonged therapy must therefore always be gradual to avoid acute adrenal insufficiency, being tapered off over weeks or months according to the dose and duration of treatment.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@DEXAMETHASONE SODIUM PHOSPHATE@@@@@DEXAMETHASONE SODIUM PHOSPHATE||||@BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM@ROXANE@@@@BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM|ROXANE|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Anaemia@Haematological Malignancy@Brain Cancer@@Supportive Care|Anaemia|Haematological Malignancy|Brain Cancer||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Corticosteroid@@@@@Corticosteroid||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@1@year@1 year@@@@1@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ORAL SOLUTION@US$@@@@@@@@50@MG@0.5 MG/5 ML@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals.@@14917440@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@@@@@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@@JANSSEN CILAG||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@DUROGESIC SMAT@@@@@DUROGESIC SMAT||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@20@1.1807@180.63@239.36@187.02@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/15/2017@9.03@9.03@550522@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@50@MCG@50 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects. The differences in potencies for carboplatin and cisplatin appear to be directly related to the difference in aquation rates.@@14919491@Indicated for the treatment of: 1. advanced ovarian carcinoma of epithelial origin in  (a) first line therapy (b) second line therapy, after other treatments have failed. 2. small cell carcinoma of the lung.@@YES@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Via acquisition of Merck KGaA generics unit@FIRST-LINE@@789@Single-Agent Therapy: has been shown to be effective in patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma at a dosage of 360 mg/m2 I.V. on day 1 every 4 weeks (alternatively see Formula Dosing).

Its onset of action is rapid and its duration of action is short. In man, a single iv dose of 0.5-1 mg/70 kg body weight immediately produces a pronounced state of surgical analgesia, respiratory depression, bradycardia and other typical morphine-like effects. The duration of action of the peak effects is about 30 minutes. All potent morphine-like drugs produce relief from pain, ventilatory depression, emesis, constipation, physical dependence, certain vagal effects and varying degrees of sedation. Fentanyl, however, differs from morphine not only by its short duration of action but also by its lack of emetic effect and minimal hypotensive activity in animals. @@14918397@Management of persistent, moderate to severe chronic pain that requires continuous, around-the-clock opioid administration for an extended period of time, and cannot be managed by other means such as non-steroidal analgesics, opioid combination products, or immediate-release opioids.@@-@-@@NO REVIEW@@@@0%@-@-@-@-@The initial Durogesic DTrans dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.@N/A@@@-@@@Using damaged or cut patches can lead to the rapid release of the contents of the patch and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of fentanyl. It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@-@-@@@-@DISCONTINUED@@-@GKV@NO LABELLED TRIAL@-@@@@-@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@ESPARMA@@@@@ESPARMA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@-@@@@@@@@@@-@@@@@-@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@-@-@@@20@1.3598@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@3/17/2015@@@2185280@TRANSDERMAL PATCH@EURO@@@@@@@@75@MCG@75 MCG/HOUR@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@92@Germany@@@@@@@@

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors.@@14918564@Epirubicin is used in the treatment of a range of neoplastic conditions including • Breast, ovarian, gastric, lung and colorectal carcinomas • Malignant lymphomas • Leukaemias • Multiple myeloma.

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14919083@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses. Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: indicated in the management of selected adults with severe, active, rheumatoid arthritis (ARC criteria), or children with active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate. Combined use of methotrexate with gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or cytotoxic agents, has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects. Rest and physiotherapy as indicated should be continued.@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@@Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@N/A@@@@@APPROVED@@@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@BEDFORD LABORATORIES@@@@@BEDFORD LABORATORIES||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Factory Price@@@@@@@@@1@1@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@55390-0143-01@INJECTION (SDV)@US$@@@@@@@@1@G@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922272@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@382@Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in multiple myeloma - The recommended dose is 90 mg every 4 weeks.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity: Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Little or no binding was observed in the non-lymphoid tissues examined.@@16750635@Previously untreated follcular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with first line chemotherapy and, in patients achieving a complete or parial response to Rituxan in combination with chemotherapy, as single-agent maintenance therapy.@Both@NA@@@@@@@@@FIRST-LINE@@1018@The recommended dose is 375 mg/m2 as an IV infusion.

In the process of DNA synthesis and cellular replication, folic acid must be reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by this enzyme, and inhibition by methotrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. It also inhibits antibody synthesis.@@14918095@Neoplastic Diseases: indicated in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Psoriasis: indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis “flare” is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses. Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: indicated in the management of selected adults with severe, active, rheumatoid arthritis (ARC criteria), or children with active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored. Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate. Combined use of methotrexate with gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or cytotoxic agents, has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects. Rest and physiotherapy as indicated should be continued.@@NO@@@NO REVIEW@@@-@@@@@@Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage llI may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses with leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.@@@@@@@1.Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.2.Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. 3.Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some NSAIDs). 4.Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. 5.Methotrexate-induced lung disease is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and which has been reported at doses as low as 7.5 mg/week. It is not always fully reversible. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. 6.Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. 7.Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted. 8.Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce “tumor lysis syndrome” in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive and pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication. 9.Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. 10.Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. 11.Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@@@@@@APPROVED@@1@RAMQ@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@METHOTREXATE@@@@@METHOTREXATE||||@HOSPIRA@@@@@HOSPIRA||||@@@@@@|||||||||@Haematological Malignancy@Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@T-Cell Lymphoma@@@Haematological Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|T-Cell Lymphoma|||||||@GENERIC@@@@@GENERIC||||@Anti-metabolite@Folic Acid Analogue@@@@Anti-metabolite|Folic Acid Analogue|||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@1@0.7881@8.92@@@@@@@@@@@@0.18@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@7/19/2017@8.92@8.92@21827772@INJECTION, 2 ML@C$@@@@@@@@50@MG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@49@Canada@@@@@@@@

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration.

Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicin's cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms.

The drug may act by mitotic inhibition, causing an arrest of cell division in metaphase. The drug is relatively marrow-sparing and is thus suitable for use in combination with other cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Vincristine is poorly absorbed orally. The clearance of the drug after rapid intravenous injection follows a triphasic decay pattern: a very rapid steep descent (alpha phase); a narrow-middle region (beta-phase) and a much longer terminal region (gamma phase). The terminal phase half-life of the drug varies from 15-155 hours. Dosing with the drug more frequently than once weekly is therefore probably unnecessary. Vincristine is primarily excreted by the biliary route. Patients with impaired hepatic or biliary function, as evidenced by a raised serum alkaline phosphatase, have been shown to have a significantly prolonged vincristine elimination half-life.@@14922038@Vincristine sulphate is used either alone or in conjunction with other oncolytic drugs for the treatment of:  1.

Patients with true ITP refractory to splenectomy and short-term treatment with adrenocortical steroids may respond to vincristine but the medicinal product is not recommended as primary treatment of this disorder. Recommended weekly doses of vincristine given for 3 to 4 weeks have produced permanent remissions in some patients.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro.

However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells.

Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).

Retacrit should be given by the subcutaneous route.   Retacrit therapy should be administered to patients with anaemia (e.g. Hb < 11 g/dl [6.8 mmol/l]). The target haemoglobin concentration is approximately 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A haemoglobin concentration of 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l) should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).  Retacrit therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.   The initial dose is 150 IU/kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week. Alternatively, Retacrit can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/kg subcutaneously once weekly.  If the haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/dl (0.62 mmol/l) or the reticulocyte count has increased  40,000 cells/µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/kg 3 times per week or 450 IU/kg once weekly.

If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased  1 g/dl (0.62 mmol/l) or the reticulocyte count has increased  40,000 cells/µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/kg 3 times per week. However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/dl (< 0.62 mmol/l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/µl above baseline, response is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.@@@@-@@@Like in all patients receiving erythropoietin, blood pressure may rise during treatment with Retacrit.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. The concomitant use of Duragesic with other central nervous system depressants, including but not  limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilisers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or potentially result in coma. The concomitant with potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.@NO LABELLED TRIAL@No@6-Nov@@@@@APPROVED@@Covered; non-preferred; quantity limit 20 for 30 days@MEDICARE@NO LABELLED TRIAL@@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE@@@@@FENTANYL CITRATE||||@JOHNSON & JOHNSON@JANSSEN CILAG@@@@JOHNSON & JOHNSON|JANSSEN CILAG|||@@@@@@|||||||||@Supportive Care@Cancer Pain@@@@Supportive Care|Cancer Pain||||||||@DURAGESIC@@@@@DURAGESIC||||@Opioid Analgesic@@@@@Opioid Analgesic||||@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Invalid Dosage Value Phase 1@@@@@@@@@5@1@362.31@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@8/2/2017@72.46@72.46@50458-0092-05@TRANSDERMAL PATCH - 15 CM2@US$@@@@@@@@50@MCG@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@244@United States@@@@@@@@

For doses above 8mg the increase in ondansetron systemic exposure with dose is greater than proportional; this may reflect some reduction in first pass metabolism at higher oral doses. Bioavailability, following oral administration, is slightly enhanced by the presence of food but unaffected by antacids. Studies in healthy elderly volunteers have shown slight, but clinically insignificant, age-related increases in both oral bioavailability (65%) and half-life (5 hours) of ondansetron.

If dosage on a mg/kg bodyweight basis is required, 2 to 10 mg/kg bodyweight/day should be used.

Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT.

Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomoting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HTs receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system.

The antigen is expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation. B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanism of Action: The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.

This is probably the result of intercalation of the anthracycline between adjacent base pairs of the DNA double helix thus preventing their unwinding for replication.@@15402486@Indicated for treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in women who have failed a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen.@@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@SECOND-LINE@@474@Breast cancer/Ovarian cancer: Caelyx is administered intravenously at a dose of 50 mg/m2 once every 4 weeks for as long as the disease does not progress and the patient continues to tolerate treatment.@@@@No@@@Cardiac toxicity: It is recommended that all patients receiving Caelyx routinely undergo frequent ECG monitoring.

It is a peptide and therefore unrelated to the steroids. Chronic administration results in an inhibition of gonadotrophin production and subsequent suppression of ovarian and testicular steroid secretion. This effect is reversible on discontinuation of therapy. Administration of leuprorelin acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of gonadotrophins which leads to a transient increase in gonadal steroid levels in both men and women. Continued administration of leuprorelin acetate results in a decrease of gonadotrophin and sex steroid levels.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922105@• Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity: Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia • Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer or multiple myeloma • Paget's disease of bone.@@NO@6-Mar@@NO REVIEW@@@@@@@@382@Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in multiple myeloma - The recommended dose is 90 mg every 4 weeks.

Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some but not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance gene.

It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral. Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone-bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pamidronate inhibits tumour-induced osteolysis when given prior to or at the time of inoculation or transplantation with tumour cells. Biochemical changes reflecting the inhibitory effect of Aredia on tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, are characterised by a decrease in serum calcium and phosphate and secondarily by decreases in urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline.@@14922270@Treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity - Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia - Osteolytic lesions in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer - Multiple myeloma stage III@@NA@@@NO REVIEW@@@@90% (MINIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR5, MAXIMUM CO-PAYMENT: EUR10)@@@@382@Osteolytic lesions and bone pain in multiple myeloma - The recommended dose is 90 mg every 4 weeks.

It should be administered to children only if they are opioid-tolerant and 2 years of age or older. Use in non-opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Overestimating the dose when converting patients from another opioid medication can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when people were accidentally exposed to it. It has been reported as being abused by other methods and routes of administration. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Duragesic should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma.

These infections may be mild, but can be severe and at times fatal. With increasing doses of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used.

In breast cancer patients, at the tumour level, tamoxifen acts primarily as an antioestrogen, preventing oestrogen binding to the oestrogen receptor. In the clinical situation, it is recognised that tamoxifen leads to reductions in levels of blood total cholesterol and low density lipoproteins in postmenopausal women of the order of 10–20%. Tamoxifen does not adversely affect bone mineral density.@@14919551@@@NO@2-Sep@@NO REVIEW@@@@@Daiichi-Sankyo has agreed the purchase of a 34.8% stake in Indian generics giant Ranbaxy owned by the Singh family, and is seeking to acquire an additional 20% stake.

This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects.
